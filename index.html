As it took an extraordinary man of will in Jackie Robinson to bear the on-the-field brunt of Rickey&#39;s daring, it took a man of equal resolve and courage to conceive and implement the plan in the first place. Rickey, creator as well of baseball&#39;s farm system, left a giant and enduring legacy. This slim volume of epigrams and observations--on character, attitude, and baseball itself--compiled from his letters, notes, and personal papers is a treasure trove of good sense, keen insight, and, indeed, some genuine inspiration, a true reflection of the singular man who penned them.</p><h2>Violin For Dummies, Book + Online Video &amp; Audio Instruction</h2><p><b>The beginner's guide to learning the violin &#x2014; for any musical style</b> <p><i>Violin For Dummies</i> helps you teach yourself to play the violin, even if you've never read a note of music.

By age sixteen, she had broken all records for swimming the English Channel. Her daring eventually led her to the Bering Strait, where she swam five miles in thirty-eight-degree water in just a swimsuit, cap, and goggles. In between those accomplishments, she became the first to swim the Strait of Magellan, narrowly escaped a shark attack off the Cape of Good Hope, and was cheered across the twenty-mile Cook Strait of New Zealand by dolphins. She even swam a mile in the Antarctic.<br> <br>Lynne writes the same way she swims, with indefatigable spirit and joy, and shares the beauty of her time in the water with a poet's eye for detail. She has accomplished yet another feat--writing a new classic of sports memoir.<br><br></p><p>Just about every other person in the world seems like an unfocused dilettante compared to long-distance swimming legend Lynne Cox. Soon At the age of 14, after several years of training hard in pools and the open sea, she was swimming the 26 mile stretch from Catalina Island to the coast of California. A year after that, she surpassed a lifelong goal by not only swimming the English Channel but setting a new men's and women's record in the process. Rather than be satisfied, Cox aimed still higher, conquering the Cook Strait in New Zealand, the Strait of Magellan and, the Cape of Good Hope, none of which had been swum before. Being the first to swim the Bering Sea from Alaska to what was then the Soviet Union is perhaps Cox's most impressive achievement, requiring a phenomenal amount of physical strength and endurance to withstand the chilly waters and diplomatic persistence to gain permission from Gorbachev during the Cold War. <i>Swimming to Antarctica</i> is Cox's remarkably detailed account of her major swims and all that went right and wrong with them. While there are plenty of highs, as one might expect in a memoir by so impressive an athlete, all is not sunshine and roses for Cox. She overcomes extreme physical hardship, predatory sharks, and a swim through a sewage-soaked Nile while suffering from dysentery. There is plenty in <i>Swimming to Antarctica</i> to encourage even non-swimmers to work hard to achieve the seemingly impossible, but Cox, a skilled and highly readable writer, sticks to the swimming, leading the reader by example. For thrills and inspiration, it's hard to find anyone better than Lynne Cox. <i>--John Moe</i>Published in hardcover by Knopf, 2004, 0-375-41507-6<br></p><h2>Object-Oriented Modeling and Design with UML</h2><p>This revision offers a crisp, clear explanation of the basics of object-oriented thinking via UML models, then presents a process for applying these principles to software development, including C++, Java, and relational databases.

A. Hayek, Vol. 1) (Volume 1)</h2><p>Hayek gives the main arguments for the free-market case and presents his manifesto on the "errors of socialism." Hayek argues that socialism has, from its origins, been mistaken on factual, and even on logical, grounds and that its repeated failures in the many different practical applications of socialist ideas that this century has witnessed were the direct outcome of these errors. He labels as the "fatal conceit" the idea that "man is able to shape the world around him according to his wishes." <br><br>"The achievement of <i>The Fatal Conceit</i> is that it freshly shows why socialism must be refuted rather than merely dismissed&#x2014;then refutes it again."&#x2014;David R. Henderson, <i>Fortune</i>. <br><br>"Fascinating. . . . The energy and precision with which Mr. Hayek sweeps away his opposition is impressive."&#x2014;Edward H. Crane, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>F. A. Hayek is considered a pioneer in monetary theory, the preeminent proponent of the libertarian philosophy, and the ideological mentor of the Reagan and Thatcher "revolutions."</p><p>Adopting an economic and evolutionary approach throughout, Hayak examines the nature, origin, selection and development of the differing moralities of socialism and the market order; he recounts the extraordinary powers that &#39;the extended order&#39; of the market, as he calls it, bestows on mankind, constituting and enabling the development of civilization.<b>F. A. Hayek</b> (1899-1992), recipient of the Medal of Freedom in 1991 and co-winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1974, was a pioneer in monetary theory&nbsp;and a leading proponent of classical liberalism&nbsp; in the twentieth century.

This &#34;is a lovingly put-together volume [with] soft, spontaneous yet thoughtful illustrations.&#34;--Kirkus Reviews.</p><p><p>Acclaimed for his picture books that speak directly to young naturalists, Jim Arnosky enjoys researching different ecological areas with his wife, Deanna. His many awards and honors include the <em>Washington Post</em>&#x2014;Children's Book Guild Award for overall contribution to nonfiction for children and the Eva L. Gordon Award for outstanding children's science literature. He has also written and illustrated numerous ALA Notable Books and Outstanding Science Books. Home base for the Arnoskys is a two-hundred-year-old farmhouse in northern Vermont. Their daughters and their families live nearby.</p>Grade 6-8 Another lovely book in which the artist-naturalist shares his pleasure in sketching the world around him. Two typefaces define the dual purpose of the booklarge print paragraphs describe Arnosky's personal experience in sketching trees, brooks, emerging spring flowers, and woodland animals; small print notes give general suggestions on drawing technique. Like his earlier Drawing from Nature (Lothrop, 1982) , the book successfully conveys the aesthetic pleasure of sketching and demonstrates how important a focused awareness of the observed world is to the artist. However, this book is less successful in describing the techniques which translate observation into a sketch. The drawing sugestions tend to be vague and subjective, so while this book can give readers a great deal of pleasure, it is not as successful at teaching drawing technique. Unlike other authors who teach simple tricks and patterns in drawing, Arnosky focuses on awareness and the connections that artists make to the objects they draw. He assumes a level of knowledge and experience beyond the scope of many young readers. While this limits the book's usefulness as a drawing book, the combination of text and beautifully executed drawings could inspire young readers, artists or not, to go into the spring woods and really look at the world around them.

Marshall McLuhan illustrates the fact that all social changes are caused by introduction of new technologies.

They are an unlikely pair: Chuck Fipke, a ragged, stuttering fellow with a singular talent for finding sand-size mineral grains, and Stew Blusson, an ultra-tough geologist and helicopter pilot. Inventive, eccentric and ruthless, they follow a trail of geologic clues left by predecessors all the way from backwoods Arkansas up the glaciated high Rockies into the vast and haunted "barren lands" of northern Canada. With a South African geochemist's "secret weapon," Fipke and Blusson outwit rivals, including the immense De Beers carte, and make one of the world's greatest diamond discoveries- setting off a stampede unseen since the Klondike gold rush.<br><br>A story of obsession and scientific intrigue, <i>Barren Lands</i> is also an elegy to one of earth's last great wild places, a starkly beautiful and mysterious land strewn with pure lakes and alive with wolves and caribou.

(<i>Christian Library Journal</i>)</p><h2>The Grail Legend</h2><p><p>The Holy Grail and its quest is a legend that has had a powerful impact on our civilization and culture. The Grail itself is an ancient Celtic symbol of plenty as well as a Christian symbol of redemption and eternal life, the chalice that caught the blood of the crucified Christ. The story of the Grail sheds profound light on man's search for the supreme value of life, for that which makes life most meaningful.</p><br><p> Writing in a clear and readable style, two leading women of the Jungian school of psychology present this legend as a living myth that is profoundly relevant to modern life. We encounter such universal figures as the Fool (the naive young Perceval), the Wise Old Man (the Hermit Gornemanz), the Virgin Maiden (Blancheflor), the Loathly Damsel, and such important themes as the Waste Land, the Trinity, and the vessel of the Grail. Weaving together narrative and interpretation, the authors show us how the legend reflects not only fundamental human problems but also the dramatic psychic events that form the background of our Christian culture. Emma Jung--analyst, writer, and wife of the famous psychologist C. G. Jung--researched and worked on this book for thirty years, until her death in 1955. Marie-Louise von Franz, also eminent in the field of depth psychology, completed the project.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Grail Legend</i> is a beautifully sustained application of Jungian theory to a whole story rather than merely to isolated motifs or archetypes.

The protagonist of Booth Tarkington's great historical drama is George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled and arrogant grandson of the founder of the family's magnificence. Eclipsed by a new breed of developers, financiers, and manufacturers, this pampered scion begins his gradual descent from the midwestern aristocracy to the working class. <br>Today The Magnificent Ambersons is best known through the 1942 Orson Welles movie, but as the critic Stanley Kauffmann noted, "It is high time that [the novel] appear again, to stand outside the force of Welles's genius, confident in its own right." <br>"The Magnificent Ambersons is perhaps Tarkington's best novel," judged Van Wyck Brooks. "[It is] a typical story of an American family and town--the great family that locally ruled the roost and vanished virtually in a day as the town spread and darkened into a city. This novel no doubt was a permanent page in the social history of the United States, so admirably conceived and written was the tale of the Ambersons, their house, their fate and the growth of the community in which they were submerged in the end."Winner of the Pulizer Prize for Fiction<p>The Magnificent Ambersons is the epic story of an American family's traumatic tumble from the dizzying heights of fame and fortune. A dynasty spanning three generations, the Ambersons' pre-eminence as society's elite is threatened -- not only by a hungry new breed of industrial entrepreneur -- but from its own arrogance and greed. At the center of the story is George Amberson Minafer, the pampered but pitiful, scion of the clan upon whose shoulders the fate of the family fortune will be won...or lost.</p><p>At once an exciting chronicle of a family's rise to fortune and its tortured downfall, it is also a fascinating portrait of the forces that shaped American society.</p></p><h2>Mayo Clinic Book of Alternative Medicine, 2nd Edition (Updated and Expanded): Integrating the Best of Natural Therapies with Conventional Medicine</h2><p>An authoritative overview of complementary and alternative medicine showcases popular therapies, remedies, practices and procedures--from acupuncture to yoga--to examine what works when treating common ailments and what can be combined with conventional medicine to promote overall health.</p><p>Mayo Clinic is one of the world's oldest and largest multispecialty group practices.

But many men pay a high price for the pursuit of success and power. Taking family and friends for granted, men will often let relationships take a back seat to their professional ambitions, only to ultimately find themselves with few real friends they can rely on in hard times. As a result, they turn to affairs, alcohol, and other self-destructive behaviors. Sadly, millions of men suffer untreated depression. </p><p>In this groundbreaking and provocative book, award-winning clinical psychologist Thomas Joiner makes an impassioned call for society to recognize the harmful effects that solitude can have on men. Drawing on original research done for the National Institute of Mental Health, he focuses on the particular situations that leave men rudderless. He offers advice on support systems that are most useful to men, and he offers prescriptive advice on how men can improve their lives.</p></p><p><p>Recognized expert in men's health, Thomas Joiner, PhD, is The Robert O.

He inhabited his own bizarre universe and obeyed no rules except his own, yet he was a familiar and characteristic American literary type: an author whose reputation rests on a single book. His life, which he described, and disguised, and distorted in all three of his books, rivaled his "fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything he did involved a struggle, and the most important struggle of his life was his writing; out of that strife came A Fan's Notes, which Jonathan Yardley believes is one of the best books of our time.<br><br>Exley was an alcoholic who drank in copious amounts, yet he always sobered up when he was ready to write. In his younger days he did time in a couple of mental institutions, which imposed involuntary discipline on him and helped him start to write. He was personally and financially irresponsible--he had no credit cards, no permanent address, and ambiguous relationships with everyone he knew--yet people loved him and took care of him.<br><br>The center of Fred's strange world was Watertown in upstate New York, where he was born and grew up. Other important points of his compass included various places in Florida and Hawaii, and a funky bar in New York's Greenwich Village called the Lion's Head. No matter where he was, in the dark of night he phoned friends and subjected them to interminable monologues. To many, these were a nuisance and an imposition, but later, in the light of day, they were remembered with affection and gratitude.<br><br>In Misfit, the Pulitzer Prize-winning book critic of The Washington Post portrays in full one of the most tormented, distinctive, and talented writers of the postwar years. Exley's story, which in Yardley's telling reads as if it were a novel, reveals a singular personality: raunchy, vulgar, self-centered, and even infantile, yet also loyal, self-deprecating, and unfailingly humorous. Sympathetic and affectionate, honest and unsparing, Yardley's portrait gives us a man who sacrificed everything in order to write and who becomes, even more than before, his own most memorable creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jonathan Yardley is the book critic and a columnist for The Washington Post. He is the author of four previous books, including Ring: A Biography of Ring Lardner and Our Kind of People: The Story of an American Family, and the editor of My Life as Author and Editor by H. L. Mencken. In 1968-69 he held a Nieman Fellowship in Journalism at Harvard University, and in 1981 was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Criticism. He lives in Baltimore and Cecil County, Maryland, with his wife, Susan Hartt Yardley.The rise and fall of a one-book wonder, told by the Pulitzer Prizewinning Washington Post literary critic. If Exley's raucous ``fictional memoir'' of failure, fame, and football, A Fan's Notes, is a cult book, then Yardley (Ring: A Biography of Ring Lardner, 1977) has been a steadfast apostle. Since its publication in 1968, he has promoted it in his newspaper writing and written an introduction to the Modern Library edition (to be published simultaneously with this biography). He was also a distant friend to Exley, ``the most elusive and mysterious of men,'' a charming and exasperating ne'er-do-well, sponger, and barstool-propping man of letters. Despite this relationship, Yardley proves tough and objective in re-creating Exley's life, which differs little in substance from A Fan's Notes. Exley (192992) was the feckless younger son of the local football hero of Watertown, a small upstate New York burg. This might have been the son's only claim to fame had he not written a book that Yardley ranks alongside Invisible Man and The Adventures of Augie March for its evocation of a young man's disaffection with the American Way. A Fan's Notes apart, the biographic trail is scant in the early years, but Yardley connects Exley's departure from mainstream life not only to his father's early death and his failed romance as an adolescent with a WASP debutante, but also to a car accident that ended his own mediocre football career and presumably gave him a taste of mortality. As much as he is a fan of Exley's debut, he dismisses as ``honorable failures'' his later Pages from a Cold Island and Last Notes from Home, which follow the self-mythologizing, vagabond contours of Fitzgeraldian romanticism and Hemingwayesque machismo in chronicling Exley's alcoholism and failed marriages. Misfit adds a dark, factual foundation to Exley's one lasting book. (photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But it is not God's Word that has changed. Indeed, its relevancy and its power to transform lives are intact. What has changed is the number of people who consult it. Now more than ever the need to read the Bible, to understand the big picture of its storyline, and to grasp the relevance this has for your life is critical.</p><p>As with its companion volume, <em>For the Love of God-Volume 1</em> , this devotional contains a systematic 365-day plan, based on the M'Cheyne Bible-reading schedule, that will in the course of a year guide you through the New Testament and Psalms twice and the rest of the Old Testament once.

Comprising chapters by the leading advocates of the Reggio Emilia approach, it examines how real teachers in real classrooms are applying the principles of Reggio Emilia on an everyday basis.

There are several down-to-earth chapters demonstrating how teachers actually construct curriculum as a joint enterprise between them and the children, and also chapters on documenting the results of that curriculum as well as suggestions for creating appropriate settings for learning. There are even chapters describing an experimental attempt to apply the Reggio principles in a number of elementary schools, and one on detailing ways to advocate for the philosophy. </p> <p> All this new material is supported by a solid explanation of the Reggio Emilia philosophy by Lella Gandini, a leading authority on that subject, and stimulated by a series of challenging questions proposed by the inimitable Lilian Katz. Finally, there is a chapter particularly dear to my heart that recounts a first time visit to Reggio by a group of students majoring in early childhood education. </p> <p> A note of caution: <i>Next Steps Toward Teaching the Reggio Way</i> is a practical book filled with inspiring, yet practical descriptions of ways various teachers have incorporated different aspects of the Reggio Emilia Approach into their early childhood classrooms. But it is NOT a handbook intended to meet the demands of the person in an audience who recently said to me, "Don't tell me all that stuff about philosophy&#x2014;just get to the bottom line&#x2014;tell me how to do Reggio and I'll do it!" </p> <p> The truth is there is no way "to do Reggio." Nor is there any author in this book who would maintain that <i>their</i> way is <i>the</i> way, or the ideal way, or perhaps the only way "to do Reggio. " Instead, the following chapters recount individual stories not about "how-to-do-it;" but more about "how-we-do-it:' It is up to the readers to garner for themselves whatever thoughts and ideas resonate within their own hearts and then begin the long and exciting adventure of incorporating these ideas into their own milieus. </p></p><h2>The Longman Anthology of World Literature: Volume C, The Early Modern Period</h2><p>The Longman Anthology of World Literature, Volume C offers a fresh and highly teachable presentation of the varieties of world literature from the early modern period.</p><p>David Damrosch is a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University.

Livingston presents a chronology and analysis of his work; Gopnik contributes a thorough biographical essay. With his brutally frank photographic style, Avedon (An Autobiography, LJ 10/15/93) influenced a generation of photographers. Either in his studio or on commission from major illustrated magazines, Avedon seems to have photographed nearly every notable celebrity of the 20th century. His images of everyday people are equally powerful, as exemplified by a series from Vietnam in 1971 and one on drifters and unemployed Americans. The book has a unique design, simultaneously providing an illustrated checklist of the 50-year retrospective exhibit at the Whitney Museum on which the book is based and an illustrated chronology of Avedon's life and work. Those interested in Avedon's career or in the fine arts will want this book, which supplements and interprets the Whitney exhibit. Highly recommended.<br><i>Kathleen Collins, New York Transit Museum Archives, Brooklyn</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.With a seeming disregard for genres, photographer Avedon applies the same compositional intelligence to animated fashion shots, nightmarish images of a state mental hospital, austere portraits of politicians, artists, writers, grainy images of drifters and factory workers. This catalogue of a retrospective at Manhattan's Whitney Museum contains many pictures that will be instantly recognizable to readers of Avedon's recent An Autobiography , but it also includes a lot of new, early and unfamiliar work. Defending Avedon against critics who charge him with cold manipulation or sensationalism, New Yorker art critic Gopnik views his work as part of a theatrical tradition in photography, a carefully orchestrated interpretation of late 20th-century life. Livingston, the exhibit's curator, provides a wide-angled critique of Avedon's opus from his 1940s studies of New York City's Central Park to recent portraits of Alabama governor George Wallace, NYC black activist Rev. Al Sharpton and gays in the military. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beowulf &amp; Other Stories: A New Introduction to Old English, Old Icelandic and Anglo-Norman Literatures</h2><p>Written with verve, panache and a deep understanding of its subject, 'Beowulf' &amp; Other Stories puts the pleasure back into studying Old English. � A new action film, Beowulf and Grendel, is out very soon and so is an animated version of the tale starring angelina Jolie and Ray Winston� There is lots of general interest in stories inspired by old English - tolkein's Lord of the Rings, Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia� The authors have a fantastic writing style - engaging, witty, insightful - this book will be a page-turner that focuses on what readers want to know, instead of what it is perceived they ought to know� Gives the real low-down on the subject - translates lots of the original text, allows readers to have a go at translation themselves, and gives readers the chance to learn some old English and some old Icelandic� Contains colour photographs - rare in this kind of book - t</p><p><p>Until now, Old English has been a phrase to strike fear into the hearts of students of English.

Though we often consider cinema to be synonymous with "Hollywood," in truth, it has spread to all parts of the globe, and is enjoyed by audiences that cut across all sections of society. <br> In <em>The Oxford History of World Cinema</em>, a worldwide team of experts traces the history of this enduringly popular entertainment medium. Covering all aspects of its development, stars, studios, and cultural impact, the book celebrates and chronicles over one hundred years of diverse achievement from westerns to the New Wave, from animation to the Avant-Garde, and from Hollywood to Hong Kong. An international team of distinguished film historians tells the story of the major inventions and developments in the cinema business, its institutions, genres, and personnel, and they outline the evolution of national cinemas round the world--the varied and distinctive filmic traditions that have developed alongside Hollywood. A unique aspect of the book are the special inset features on the film-makers and personalities-- Garbo and Godard, Keaton and Kurosawa, Bugs Bunny and Bergman--who have had an enduring impact in popular memory and cinematic lore. With over 280 illustrations, a full bibliography, and an extensive index, this is the buff's ultimate guide to cinema worldwide.<br> From the silent film era to the first "talkies," from martial-arts thrillers to reflective costume dramas, from the talents of actors to the talents of special-effects wizards, cinema has enjoyed a unique and highly visible history. <em>The Oxford History of World Cinema</em> charts this history with all of the impact of the artform itself, and will delight anyone who has ever spent an evening at the movies.</p><p>Most histories of the international cinema focus on the careers of prominent directors. But the authors of <b>The Oxford History of World Cinema</b> set cinematic genres, trends, and national themes at the fore, composing a history of the cinema that is equally a history of our multifarious world culture. Still, in deference to the older historical style, the text of this hefty book is dotted with hundreds of minibiographies on individual filmmakers. The result of this hybrid approach is one of the most comprehensive film histories ever, allowing insight into its complex subject from a number of different perspectives.<br><em>About the Editor:</em><br><strong>Geoffrey Nowell-Smith</strong> is Project Director for European Filmography, and Fellow of the European Humanities Research Centre at Oxford University.<br></p><h2>The Search for the Origins of Christian Worship: Sources and Methods for the Study of Early Liturgy</h2><p>Traditional liturgical scholarship has generally been marked by an attempt to fit together the various pieces of evidence for the practice of early Christian worship in such a way as to suggest that a single, coherent line of evolution can be traced from the apostolic age to the fourth century. Paul Bradshaw examines this methodology in the light of recent developments in Jewish liturgical scholarship, of current trends in New Testament studies, and of the nature of the source-documents themselves, and especially the ancient church orders. In its place he offers a guide to Christian liturgical origins which adopt a much more cautious approach, recognizing the limitations of what can truly be known, and takes seriously the clues pointing to the essentially variegated character of ancient Christian worship.</p><p>Paul F.

In this novel, Amy Levy examines both the opportunities and dangers of urban experience for women in the late nineteenth century who pursue independent work rather than follow the established paths of domestic service. By outfitting her characters as photographers, Levy emphasizes the importance of the gendered gaze in this narrative of the modern city. </p> <p> This Broadview edition prints for the first time since the 1880s Levy&#x2019;s essay on Christina Rossetti and a short story set in North London, both published in Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s magazine <em>The Woman&#x2019;s World</em>. Other appendices include poetry by Levy, Michael Field, Dollie Radford, and A. Mary F.

Levy, an Anglo-Jewish poet and novelist who was educated at Newnham College and frequented the London circles of Eleanor Marx and Olive Schreiner, has been the subject of increasing interest over the last ten years. Levy&#x2019;s novel chronicles the romance of work and the trials of independent urban life for the &#x2018;new woman&#x2019;; Susan David Bernstein gives us a splendid edition, with appendices that include Levy&#x2019;s essays and poems, reviews, and other invaluable contemporary materials.&#x201d; &#x2015; Deborah Nord, Princeton University </p></p><h2>The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to Paganism</h2><p><p>You&#x2019;re no idiot, of course.

This is her first fiction work, making <i>The Delusion</i> her debut novel. Laura and her husband Patrick have a busy home life in Cypress, Texas, with their four children.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;On the surface, Owen is a typical high school student at a small-town school in Texas. He runs track, has a pretty girlfriend, and is set on starting college in a few months. Yes, it's a little strange that he inherited a chunk of land from grandparents he never met, but it's not that strange&#x2014;not like the fact that 11 students at Masonville High have committed suicide in a single school year. Things get stranger still after Owen drinks from an old well in the woods on his property. He wakes up seeing chains and shackles wrapped around the people of Masonville, but they seem oblivious to their bindings. Hateful words like die, suffer, and rage are graffitied throughout the town, but only Owen sees them. And then there are the Creepers&#x2014;hideous, demonlike creatures that Owen starts to see everywhere, playing with the emotions of the shackled. A war between good and evil is taking place in Masonville and Owen is the only one who can see the truth. This is Christian fiction with a horror twist. Only followers of Christ are somewhat immune to the Creepers, and Owen struggles with the idea that God may be real in spite of all the bad things happening around him. This isn't an easy, instant conversion tale. The ending is slightly over the top, but sets readers up for a second book.

Set in Eatonville, Florida--Hurston's hometown and the inspiration for much of her fiction--this energetic and often farcical play centers on Jim and Dave, a two-man song-and-dance team, and Daisy, the woman who comes between them. Overcome by jealousy, Jim hits Dave with a mule bone and hilarity follows chaos as the town splits into two factions: the Methodists, who want to pardon Jim; and the Baptists, who wish to banish him for his crime.</p><p>Included in this edition is the fascinating account of the <em>Mule Bone</em> copyright dispute between Hurston and Hughes that ended their friendship and prevented the play from being performed until its debut production at the Lincoln Center Theater in New York City in 1991--sixty years after it was written.

In a provocative exploration of the past, present, and future of water in the West, James Lawrence Powell begins at Lake Powell, the vast reservoir that has become an emblem of this story. At present, Lake Powell is less than half full. Bathtub rings ten stories tall encircle its blue water; boat ramps and marinas lie stranded and useless. To refill it would require surplus water&#x2015;but there is no surplus: burgeoning populations and thirsty crops consume every drop of the Colorado River. Add to this picture the looming effects of global warming and drought, and the scenario becomes bleaker still. <i>Dead Pool, </i>featuring rarely seen historical photographs, explains why America built the dam that made Lake Powell and others like it and then allowed its citizens to become dependent on their benefits, which were always temporary. Writing for a wide audience, Powell shows us exactly why an urgent threat during the first half of the twenty-first century will come not from the rising of the seas but from the falling of the reservoirs.</p><p>"<i>Dead Pool </i>is the best book I know about the current state of the Colorado River and the policy issues facing it."&#x2015;Donald Worster, author of <i>Rivers of Empire </i><br><br>"<i>Dead Pool </i>offers a powerful epitaph to the era of big dams.

The only prerequisites are calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra. Along with discussions of the major topics, including discrete dynamical systems, chaos, fractals, nonlinear differential equations and bifurcations, the text also includes Lab Visits -- short reports that illustrate relevant concepts from the physical, chemical and biological sciences. There are Computer Experiments throughout the text that present opportunities to explore dynamics through computer simulations, designed for use with any software package. And each chapter ends with a Challenge, guiding students through an advanced topic in the form of an extended exercise.</p><p><br><p>From the reviews:</p> <p>"... Written by some prominent contributors to the development of the field ... With regard to both style and content, the authors succeed in introducing junior/senior undergraduate students to the dynamics and analytical techniques associated with nonlinear systems, especially those related to chaos ... There are several aspects of the book that distinguish it from some other recent contributions in this area ... The treatment of discrete systems here maintains a balanced emphasis between one- and two- (or higher-) dimensional problems. This is an important feature since the dynamics for the two cases and methods employed for their analyses may differ significantly. Also, while most other introductory texts concentrate almost exclusively upon discrete mappings, here at least three of the thirteen chapters are devoted to differential equations, including the Poincare-Bendixson theorem. Add to this a discussion of $\omega$-limit sets, including periodic and strange attractors, as well as a chapter on fractals, and the result is one of the most comprehensive texts on the topic that has yet appeared." <em>Mathematical Reviews</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Independent Study: The Testing, Book 2 (The Testing, 2)</h2><p>In the series debut <i>The Testing</i>, sixteen-year-old Cia Vale was chosen by the United Commonwealth government as one of the best and brightest graduates of all the colonies . . . a promising leader in the effort to revitalize postwar civilization. In <i>Independent Study</i>, Cia is a freshman at the University in Tosu City with her hometown sweetheart, Tomas&#x2014;and though the government has tried to erase her memory of the brutal horrors of The Testing, Cia remembers. Her attempts to expose the ugly truth behind the government&#x2019;s murderous programs put her&#x2014;and her loved ones&#x2014;in a world of danger. But the future of the Commonwealth depends on her.</p><p><p><b>Joelle Charbonneau</b> began telling stories as an opera singer, but these days she finds her voice through writing.

Blue, long-sleeved tunic. Gray pants. Silver bracelet with a single star. The star and the smudges of fatigue under my eyes mark me as an entry-level University student. My fellow classmates show similar signs of having studied late into the night for today. After six months of taking the same preliminary classes, all twenty of us will be tested and sorted into the fields of study that will serve as the focus for the rest of our lives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My chest tightens. I used to enjoy taking tests. I liked proving that I had learned. That I had worked hard. That I was smart. But now I am not sure what is real or what the consequences of a wrong answer will be. While my classmates are concerned about the test affecting the years ahead, I worry I will not survive the day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, I pull my hair back into a thick dark knot in order to keep it out of my way. Today, I decide to leave it down. Perhaps the long waves will hide the evidence of months of restless nights. If not, maybe the cold compresses my mother taught me to apply to my eyes will help.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wave of longing crashes over me at the thought of my mother. While contact between University students and their families is not expressly forbidden, neither is it encouraged. Most students I know have not heard a word from their loved ones back home. I have been fortunate. A Tosu official has been willing to pass along small bits of communication from my parents and four older brothers. They are well. My father and my oldest brother, Zeen, are creating a new fertilizer to help plants grow faster. My second oldest brother, Hamin, is engaged. He and his soon-to-be wife will be married next spring. His decision to marry has prompted our mother to look for wives for Zeen and my twin brothers, Hart and Win. So far, her efforts have been in vain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from my family, one other person has managed to get news to me. My best friend, Daileen, assures me she&#x2019;s studying hard and is currently first in her class. Her teacher has hinted Daileen might be chosen for The Testing this year. She is keeping her fingers crossed that she will join me in Tosu City. I am hoping she will fail. I want her to stay in a place where the answers to questions make sense. Where I know she will be safe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knock at the door makes me jump. &#x201c;Hey, Cia. Are you ready? We don&#x2019;t want to be late.&#x201d; Stacia&#x2019;s right. Those who arrive late will not be allowed to take the exam. What that means for the future is unclear, but none of us wants to find out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be ready in a minute,&#x201d; I yell as I kneel next to the foot of the bed and slide my hand between the bed frame and the mattress. My fingers search until they find the lump that makes me sigh with relief. My brother Zeen&#x2019;s Transit Communicator is still safe, as are the secrets it holds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Months ago, I discovered the symbol I carved into the device to help lead me to the recorder and the confidences stored inside. When I finished listening to words I had no recollection of speaking, I cut open the mattress and hid the Communicator inside. Week after week, month after month, I tried to pretend that what the device revealed isn&#x2019;t real. After all, haven&#x2019;t I seen evidence every day that my fellow students are good people? That the professors and administrators working to prepare us for our futures want us to succeed? Some of them are standoffish. Others arrogant. None of the students or educators is perfect, but who is? No matter their flaws, I don&#x2019;t want to believe any are capable of the whispered, sometimes hard to make out words inside the recorder.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cia.&#x201d; Stacia&#x2019;s voice pulls me from my thoughts. &#x201c;We have to get going.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Right. Sorry.&#x201d; I slip into my coat, hoist my University bag onto my shoulder, and turn my back on my questions about the past. Those will have to wait. For now, I need to concentrate on my future.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacia frowns as I step into the hall. Her dark blond hair is pulled back into a sleek ponytail, making her angular features look sharper than usual. &#x201c;What took you so long? We&#x2019;re going to be the last ones to arrive.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Which will make everyone nervous,&#x201d; I quip. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll wonder why we didn&#x2019;t feel the need to get there early and compare notes with everyone else.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacia&#x2019;s eyes narrow as she nods. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I love psyching out the competition.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hate it. My parents taught me to value fair play over all else.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacia doesn&#x2019;t notice my discomfort as we trek past healthy trees, thriving grass, and numerous academic structures. Not that she would say anything if she did. Stacia isn&#x2019;t one for girl talk or idle chatter. At first her silences challenged me to bring her out of her shell, as I used to do for my best friend from Five Lakes. Now, with so many questions on my mind, I am grateful for the quiet company.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wave at a couple of older students as they walk by. As always, they ignore us. After today, the upperclassmen assigned to the same field of study will act as our guides. Until then, they pretend we don&#x2019;t exist. Most of my classmates have taken to ignoring them back, but I can&#x2019;t. My upbringing is too strong not to be polite.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Ha. I should have known he&#x2019;d be waiting for us.&#x201d; Stacia rolls her eyes and then laughs. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d bet my family&#x2019;s compensation money that he hovered around you during The Testing, too. Too bad I&#x2019;ll never know if I&#x2019;d win that bet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart skips as I spot Tomas Endress standing near the front door of the four-story red and white brick Early Studies building. His dark hair blows in the late-winter breeze. A University bag is slung carelessly over his shoulder. His gray eyes and dimpled smile are focused squarely on me as he waves and comes bounding down the steps. Tomas and I have known each other all our lives, but in the last couple months, we&#x2019;ve grown closer than I dreamed possible back home. When Tomas is with me, I feel smarter. More confident. And terrified that everything I think I know and admire about him is a lie.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stacia rolls her eyes as Tomas kisses my cheek and entwines his fingers with mine. &#x201c;I was starting to get worried about you. The test starts in ten minutes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Cia and I didn&#x2019;t feel the need to get here early and cram like everyone else. We&#x2019;re totally prepared. Right, Cia?&#x201d; Stacia tosses her blond ponytail and shoots me one of her rare smiles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; I say with more conviction than I feel. Yes, I have studied hard for this test, but the whispered words on the Transit Communicator make me doubt I could ever fully prepare for what is to come.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for the first time, I wish my father were here to talk to me. Almost three decades ago, he attended the University. Growing up, I asked hundreds of questions about his time here. Rarely did he answer them. Back then, I assumed his silence was to keep my brothers and me from feeling pressure to follow in his footsteps. Now I&#x2019;m forced to wonder if something more sinister lay behind his secrecy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one way to find out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of us climb the steps. When we reach the front door, Tomas stops and asks for a moment alone with me. Stacia sighs, warns me not to be late, and stalks inside. When she&#x2019;s out of sight, Tomas brushes a hair off my forehead and peers into my eyes. &#x201c;Did you sleep at all last night?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Some.&#x201d; Although with sleep comes the nightmares that hover just out of reach when I wake. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. Being your study partner means I can answer questions no matter how tired I am.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While other students used their free time to relax or explore the United Commonwealth capital, Tosu City, Tomas and I spent all our spare moments with our books under a tree or in the library when the cold weather drove us inside. Most of our classmates assumed Tomas and I pretended to study in order to be alone. They don&#x2019;t understand my fear of what might happen if I do not pass this exam.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomas gives my hand a squeeze. &#x201c;Things will get easier once we&#x2019;ve been given our designated areas of study. You&#x2019;re a shoo-in for Mechanical Engineering.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hope you&#x2019;re right.&#x201d; I smile. &#x201c;While I&#x2019;d love to work with you, the idea of being assigned Biological Engineering scares the hell out of me.&#x201d; My father and brothers are geniuses at coaxing plants to thrive in the war-scarred earth. Revitalizing the earth is an important job. One I admire. I might even be happy to consider it, if I didn&#x2019;t kill every plant I touched.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d; Tomas brushes a light kiss on my lips and tugs me toward the steps. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s show them how smart students from Five Lakes are.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hallway of the Early Studies building is dim. Only the sunshine that creeps in from the glass panes in the front door lights our way. Tosu City has strict laws governing electricity usage. While the production and storage of electricity are more robust than in Five Lakes, conservation is encouraged. During the daytime, the University only directs electricity to labs or classrooms that require extra light for the day&#x2019;s lesson. At night, however, the University has a much higher allotment of power than the rest of the city.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second-floor examination room is well illuminated in honor of today&#x2019;s test. The lights make it easy to see the tension etched in my classmates&#x2019; faces as they sit behind black desks, poring over their notes, hoping to cram one last fact that could make the difference between the futures they want and whatever else our professors might decide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final student arrives. I take a seat at an empty desk in the back. Tomas slides into the desk to the right of mine. I put my bag on the floor and glance around the room. Twenty of us. Thirteen boys. Seven girls. The future leaders of the United Commonwealth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am about to wish Tomas luck when Professor Lee arrives. For the past several months, Professor Lee has served as our history instructor. While most of the University teachers wear sober expressions, Professor Lee has kind eyes and a warm smile, which is why he&#x2019;s my favorite. Today, instead of the faded brown jacket he favors, our instructor is wearing a ceremonial purple United Commonwealth jumpsuit. The room goes silent as Professor Lee walks up and down the rows of desks. On each desk he drops a booklet of paper and a yellow pencil. I run my hand over the image in the corner of the booklet&#x2019;s cover. A lightning bolt. My symbol. Given to me in The Testing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Lee asks us not to open the booklet until further instruction is given. The booklet is thick. Back at Five Lakes, paper is harder to come by, so we use it sparingly and make sure to recycle every page when we are done. Here in Tosu City, learning takes priority over rationing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fingers toy with the pencil, rolling it back and forth across the black desk surface. Out of the corner of my eye, I catch Tomas watching me with a concerned expression. Suddenly, I&#x2019;m in a different room. Eight students. A different male official dressed in ceremonial male purple. Eight black desks. Bright white walls instead of gray. Six boys. Only two girls in the room, one of whom is me. Tomas gives me the same worried look as I finger a pencil. The booklet in front of me is marked with the same lightning bolt, only this time, it is surrounded by an eight-pointed star. My symbol surrounded by the symbol of my group for The Testing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room in my memory disappears as Professor Lee&#x2019;s deep voice announces, &#x201c;Congratulations on completing the basic studies required for all University students. Today&#x2019;s test, combined with evaluations from your professors, will determine which field of study your skills are best suited for. Tomorrow, a list will be posted with your test results, as well as which field of study you have been directed into: Education, Biological Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Medicine, or Government. All five fields of study are necessary to continue the revitalization of our land, our technology, and our citizens. While each of you has a preferred choice, we ask you to trust us to slot you into the career path that best suits the needs of the country. Do not attempt to guess which questions on the examination affect direction into a specific field of study. Any students with questionable test results will be given a failing grade and Redirected from the University student roster.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Lee scans the room to make sure the impact of his words is felt. I can hear my heart hammer in the silence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he continues. &#x201c;Answer each question to the best of your ability. Do not give answers beyond the scope of the question. We are interested in learning not only how much you know but how well you comprehend the question being asked. Answers that go beyond the confines of the question will negatively affect your test results.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swallow hard and wonder what the negative effect might be. A lowered score or something more?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You will have eight hours to complete this examination. If you need a break for food, water, or to relieve yourself, please raise your hand. A University official will escort you to the break room. If at any time you exit this room, you are not to leave the building or speak to anyone other than your escort. Either action will result in a failing grade and Redirection from the University. When you have completed the examination, raise the test booklet. I will collect the booklet and escort you to the door. What you do after that is up to you.&#x201d; He gives us a knowing smile before pushing a button on the wall behind him.</p></p><h2>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Illustrated Junior Library)</h2><p>Revered by all of the town's children and dreaded by all of its mothers, Huckleberry Finn is indisputably the most appealing child-hero in American literature. Unlike the tall-tale, idyllic world of Tom Sawyer, <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is firmly grounded in early reality. From the abusive drunkard who serves as Huckleberry's father, to Huck's first tentative grappling with issues of personal liberty and the unknown, Huckleberry Finn endeavors to delve quite a bit deeper into the complexities-both joyful and tragic of life.<p><br></p></p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Morgan shows how the challenge of British taxation started Americans on a search for constitutional principles to protect their freedom, and eventually led to the Revolution. By demonstrating that the founding fathers&#x2019; political philosophy was not grounded in theory, but rather grew out of their own immediate needs, Morgan paints a vivid portrait of how the founders&#x2019; own experiences shaped their passionate convictions, and these in turn were incorporated into the Constitution and other governmental documents. <i>The Birth of the Republic</i> is the classic account of the beginnings of the American government, and in this fourth edition the original text is supplemented with a new foreword by Joseph J. Ellis and a historiographic essay by Rosemarie Zagarri.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Edmund S.

He is unfair neither to Britain nor to the colonies.&#x201d;<br> (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Apart from its uplifting argument, part of the appeal of <i>The Birth of the Republic </i>is its prose style, which is blissfully bereft of academic jargon, sophisticated but simple in a way that scholarly specialists find impressive and ordinary readers find comprehensible. Morgan makes the story he is telling take precedence over the note cards he has assembled. He regards narrative as the highest form of analysis, and he has a natural gift for telling a story, silently digesting mountains of historical evidence to produce the distilled essence of the issue at stake.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Joseph J.

Thomas Jefferson's purchase of the Louisiana Territories (bought from France at a mere four cents an acre!), Lewis and Clark's daring expedition through this wilderness, the War of 1812 a.k.a. "Revolutionary War, Part II," Tecumseh's effort to form an Indian confederacy, the growth of Southern plantations, the beginning of the abolitionist movement, and the disgraceful Trail of Tears are just a few of the setbacks, sidetracks, and formidable tasks put in the new nation's path. Master storyteller Joy Hakim weaves these dramatic events and more into a seamless tale that's so exciting, how could it be true?

In the absence of knowing who we truly are, humans are doomed to continually re-create a world of suffering.<br><br> <em> The purpose of this Course is to establish your identity. . . . You become confused between the personal self and a true Self only because you have not as yet identified your true Self. Once you have identified your true Self all such confusion will end. </em>(C:27.4, 5) <br><br> ACOL can be quite challenging because it is a radical departure from ordinary experience. It can lead to wonderful revelations, but may also lead to an awareness of our habitual limitations, which can be a painful discovery. ACOL is a call to move into love's embrace, into union with the One. Central to ACOL is the direct knowing of Union, or God. Direct knowing of God follows from naturally from knowing who we really are as both human and divine. ACOL--<br><br> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; � &nbsp; Reveals a way of direct knowing through wholeheartedness, the union of mind and heart <br></strong> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; � &nbsp; Takes us beyond learning to present moment discovery<br></strong> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; � &nbsp; Brings an experience of the essential Oneness of all, through holy relationship with everything<br></strong> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; � &nbsp; Brings emotional freedom by integrating suppressed feelings <br></strong> <strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; � &nbsp; Readies humankind to be the second coming of Christ and to create a new world <br></strong> <br> Though it stands by itself, ACOL is complementary to&nbsp;<em>A Course in Miracles.</em> It was received by Mari Perron over three years. Like ACIM, ACOL presents itself in the Voice of Jesus. Many students of ACIM recognize the Voice. <br><br> ACOL is often experienced as more of a transmission than a text. It keeps on revealing more, even to those who have read it numerous times before. Many readers find it to be truly alive. <br><br> Despite its name as a course of love, ACOL does not teach love. <em> Love cannot be taught but only recognized. </em> ACOL leads to the re-discovery our shared heartbeat, a union with One and a relationship with All. <br><br> And despite its name as a course, it does not call for effort but for awareness. <em> While you continue to put effort into learning what cannot be learned, as you continue to see yourself as a student seeking to acquire what you do not yet have, you cannot recognize the unity in which you exist. </em>(C:20.9)<br><br> ACOL invites the reader to recover a memory that your heart has never lost. The goal is beyond learning, or awareness through a receptive heart. The goal is direct knowing through realizing one's true identity. <br><br> ACOL is for people of diverse spiritual backgrounds, including those unfamiliar with A Course in Miracles. However, ACOL says there is a close relationship between the two Courses:<br><br> <em> A Course in Miracles and A Course of Love work hand-in-hand because the change of thinking taught within A Course in Miracles was a change of thinking about yourself. It attempted to dislodge the ego-mind that has provided you with an identity that you but think you are. A Course of Love then followed in order to reveal to you who you truly are. (T2:4.3)</em></p><p>I have been a full-time <em>A Course In Miracles</em> teacher/facilitator/student for over 33 years and a teacher/student of <em>A Course of Love</em> for over 7 years. <em>A Course In Miracles</em> concludes by saying, "This course is a beginning, not an end." In my opinion, <em>A Course of Love</em> is the natural next step. <em>A Course of Love</em> is MIND BLOWING and totally illuminating. It takes you to the next level of awakening. I highly, highly recommend it. <br><b><em>Earl Purdy, New Thought Teacher/Lecturer &amp; Coach, Unity, Denver</em></b><br><br><em>A Course of Love</em> is a profound read. It is to the heart what <em>A Course in Miracles</em> is to the mind. I recommend it highly to any serious Course student. <br><b><em>Rev. Kevin Rice, frequent Unity Guest Speaker; President and CEO, The Academy of Spiritual Awakening; and Author,</em> The Game of Love</b><br><br><em>A Course of Love</em> is a book for open-hearted and willing adventurers, lovers and risk-takers. It is an invitation to abandon all you think you know, and to live into a constant coming to know, co-creating the new right here, right now. It s time. Trust yourself. Hold on to nothing. Expect everything. You won t be disappointed. <br><b><em>Christina Strutt, Founder, CoCreating Clarity</em></b><br><br>Having taught and studied<em> A Course in Miracles</em> for decades, I was, at first, skeptical of <em>A Course of Love</em>. An internal voice urged me forward, however, and words cannot express my gratitude for the miracles I have witnessed and experienced as a result of working with <em>A Course of Love</em>. The un-doing process it facilitates is gentle and loving, yet the results are undeniable. Every single student in my classes has experienced unprecedented shifts in consciousness and life-changing heart openings. <em>A Course of Love</em> is a sweet springboard to freedom. <br><b><em>Laurel Elstrom, ACIM and ACOL Teacher of 30 years, Minister, Life Coach, and Author of the upcoming</em> DIY Enlightenment</b><br><br><em>A Course in Miracles</em> inoculated me forever against falsehood and bad ideas. Then <em>A Course of Love</em> appeared and set my heart dancing, reminding me that Love's bag of tricks is never-ending. <br><b><em>Michael Mark, author, poet &amp; blogger,</em> EmbracingForever.com</b><br><br><em>A Course of Love</em> is the response to our desire for a dialogue with the heart. It is essential for our return to love. Allow it to embrace and transform you, as I have. Receive this course now, as time is of the essence. <br><b><em>Akilah t Zuberi, PhD, futurist and author, </em>The You Scriptures</b><br><br>I was fortunate to read an advance copy of <em>A Course of Love (Book One)</em> and found it packed with incredible wisdom, so much so that I made numerous references to it in my own award-winning book. I highly recommend it. <br><b><em>John Renesch, businessman-turned-futurist, author,</em> The Great Growing Up</b><br><br><em>A Course of Love</em> is Jesus's next step after we conclude <em>A Course in Miracles</em>. What do we do after we relinquish the ego? The answer, revealed in <em>A Course of Love</em>, is to be the Self fully, to sustain that being, and ultimately to embody the gift of Christ-consciousness. Then and only then do we move into eternity, where we find a universe of love to enjoy and a universe of love to create. <br><b><em>Celia Hales, author of Miracles Each Day blog; religion librarian (ret.), Univ. of Minnesota; 30+ year ACIM student</em></b><br><br>Trauma patients are fearful and hurting when they come into my ER. They need compassion, the right medicines, and warm blankets for comfort. In a similar manner, Jesus's <em>A Course of Love</em>, received by Mari Perron, provides deep compassion, love, and support that will guide you through the journey of your life back into the heart of God. --<b><em>Rodney Chelberg, MD, Bangor, ME</em></b></p><h2>Mr. Shmooze: The Art and Science of Selling Through Relationships</h2><p>Reorient your selling approach<br> <br> <p><i>Mr. Shmooze</i> is the parable of a man who reveals the secret shared by all superstar salespeople.

Professor Sperber&#39;s account, which is supplemented by extensive notes for further reading and potted biographies of the principal individuals involved, incorporates the very latest scholarship on the revolution as a social and political mass movement. It describes the events of the various national revolutions (both in 1848, and the subsequent, often-neglected period 1849-51), analyses the contrasting social and political tensions underlying the outbreak of revolution, explores the different varieties of revolutionary experience, and compares the events of 1848-51 both with the previous wave of 1789-95 and the successor of 1917-23.</p><p>The European Revolutions, 1848-1851 is a student textbook, designed to introduce, in an accessible manner, all the principal themes and problems of this sometimes bewildering period in European history.

C.</h2><p>This book introduces the reader to the serious study of Greek history, concentrating more on problems than on narrative. The topics selected have been prominent in modern research and references to important discussions of these have been provided. Outlined are controversial issues of which differing views can be defended. Mr. Sealey's preference is for interpretations which see Greek history as the interaction of personalities, rather than for those which see it as a struggle for economic classes or of abstract ideas.<br><br>Sealey assumes that the Greek cities of the archaic and classical periods did not inherit any political institutions from the Bronze Age; that the extensive invasions that brought Mycenaean civilization to an end destroyed political habits as effectively as stone palaces. Accordingly, he believes that the Greeks of the historic period were engaged in the fundamental enterprise of building organized society out of nothing.<br><br>The first chapters of this work deal with the stops taken by the early tyrants, in Sparta and Athens, toward constructing stable organs of authority and of political expression. In later chapters, interest shifts to relations that developed between the states and especially to the development of lasting alliances. Attention is given to the Peloponnesian League, to the Persian Wars, to the Delian League, and to the Second Athenian Sea League of the fourth century.</p><p>&#34;One of the best works in this field. . . .

The first edition of this best-selling book received worldwide acclaim for its lucid style and wide-ranging exploration of the universe. This eagerly awaited second edition updates and greatly extends the first with seven new chapters that explore early scientific cosmology, Cartesian and Newtonian world systems, cosmology after Newton and before Einstein, special relativity, observational cosmology, inflation and creation of the universe. All chapters conclude with a section entitled Reflections containing provocative topics that will foster lively debate. The new Projects section, also at the end of each chapter, raises questions and issues to challenge the reader.</p><p>Don't say we didn't warn you: this book may well blow your mind. Of course, boggled brains are an occupational hazard in cosmology, the branch of astrophysics that studies the universe on its very largest scales. Practitioners of the field talk about the origin of time and the possibility of parallel universes in the way most people make shopping lists. But why should they have all the fun? This long-awaited update to Harrison's classic textbook is ideal for those who have exhausted the beginners' accounts and want to dig deep into the science and philosophy. Harrison offers fresh ways to think about basic principles, and he strolls down long-forgotten byways that give such richness to the subject. Unfortunately, the book does not keep up with the fast-paced changes of the past several years, including the mounting evidence for cosmic acceleration and a cosmological constant. But then, there are Scientific American articles for that. <p><i>EDITORS OF SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN</i></p>"Unusual, discursive, nonmathematical, full of reflective comments and disturbing questions, packed with unexpected citations....A beginning serious interest in cosmology can find no better satisfaction than in this helpful overview...this book may well blow your mind." Scientific American<br><br>"This very well written book belongs on the shelf of all physicists and in all libraries." Choice<br><br>"Harrison's text owes its appeal to its literate presentation of a wide variety of cosmological topics, from the creation myths of ancient Babylon to the relativistic models of Alexander Friedman...so much of Harrison's book is timeless, and so much of it is unique, that it deserves to stay in print for a long time. Like the subject of cosmology itself, Harrison's Cosmology is simultaneously uplifiting and exasperating. Perhaps that is why I admire it so much and will be recommending it to students for many years to come."

Presented here is a study of the emergence of horizontal divisions, or socio-economic classes, in a country with strong vertical divisions based on ethnicity, religious ideology, and regional particularism. Professor Abrahamian focuses on the class and ethnic roots of the major radical movements in the modem era, particularly the constitutional movement of the 1900s, the communist Tudeh party of the 1940s, the nationalist struggle of the early 1950s, and the Islamic upsurgence of the 1970s.</p><p>In this examination of the social bases of Iranian politics, Professor Abrahamian draws on archives of the British Foreign Office and India Office that have only recently been opened; newspaper, memoirs, and biographies published in Tehran between 1906 and 1980; proceedings of the Iranian Majles and Senate; interviews with retired and active politicians; and pamphlets, books, and periodicals distributed by exiled groups in Europe and North America in the period between 1953 and 1980.</p><p>Professor Abrahamian explores the impact of socio-economic change on the political structure, especially under the reigns of Reza Shah and Muhammad Reza Shah, and throws fresh light on the significance of the Tudeh party and the failure of the Shah's regime from 1953 to 1978.</p></p><p>Emphasizing the interaction between political organizations and social forces, Ervand Abrahamian discusses Iranian society and politics during the period between the Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1909 and the Islamic Revolution of 1977-1979.<b>Ervand Abrahamian</b> is Professor of History at Baruch College, City University of New York.</p><h2>Major Problems in American Popular Culture (Major Problems in American History Series)</h2><p>MAJOR PROBLEMS IN AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE presents essays and documents that focus on the history of American popular culture with an analytic framework based on race, class, gender, and nationalism.</p><p>Kathleen Franz is an associate professor of history and director of public history at American University.

The conflict had its roots in political and ideological disagreements dating back to the Russian Revolution of 1917--disagreements that intensified in the wake of World War II. Allan M. Winkler excerpts speeches by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to demonstrate the growing abyss between the two political systems. President Harry S. Truman's announcement of the existence of a Soviet atomic bomb and his speech to Congress launching the Truman Doctrine testify to the gravity of the situation. The cold war was not always "cold"--armed conflicts were narrowly avoided in the Cuban missile crisis and the Bay of Pigs, and war did erupt in Korea and Vietnam. The complex politics of the Vietnam War are represented by voices as divergent as Vietnamese nationalist Ho Chi Minh, President Lyndon B. Johnson, antiwar protesters, and a participant in the My Lai massacre.<br> Cold war paranoia permeated American society. The investigations of writer Ring Lardner, Jr., and government official Alger Hiss by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee, along with speeches by Senator Joe McCarthy, lay bare the political repression at home generated by the perceived communist threat. Excerpts from Arthur Miller's play <em>The Crucible</em> and the film script of <em>High Noon</em> capture the mood of uncertainty and fear. A picture essay entitled "The Atom Unleashed" collects photographs and cartoons to explore one of the most controversial discoveries of the 20th century. Agreements made in the SALT treaties show the cold war finally coming to an end. In his 1992 State of the Union address, President Bush declared, "By the grace of God, America won the cold war."</p><p><br><em>Allan M. Winkler</em> is Professor of History and former Chair of the History Department at Miami University, Oxford, OH. His recent books include <em>America: Pathways to the Present</em> and <em>Life under a Cloud: American Anxiety about the Atom</em> (OUP, 1993).<br><br>"During the Cold War - often referred to as a war of spies - policymakers' public statements could not always be relied upon to determine their governments' intentions. What cannot be argued with are their documents. <em>The Cold War: A History of Documents</em> provides us with these most valuable resources and enables us to get to the bottom of many of the major Cold War developments.

Studies show that students learn words best by seeing them repeatedly in different contexts, not through rote memorization. The books present each word in at least seven different contexts. Every encounter increases the chance that a word will become part of a student&#39;s permanent word bank. Abundant Practice. In addition to the extensive practice in each chapter, there are unit tests and a crossword puzzle review. Moreover, most chapters repeat words from earlier chapters, allowing for even more reinforcement. And there are added tests in the Test Bank and the Online Learning Center. All this practice means that students learn in the best possible way: by working closely and repeatedly with each word.

A candid, thinly-veiled portrait of the late-1930s&nbsp;New York intellectual scene, its penetrating gaze and creative fusion of life and&nbsp;literature--"mutual plagiarism," she called it--became the hallmark of McCarthy's&nbsp;fiction, which the Library of America now presents in full for the first time in&nbsp;deluxe collector's edition. <i>The Oasis</i> (1949), a wicked satire about a failed utopian&nbsp;community, and <i>The Groves of Academe</i> (1952), a pioneering campus novel&nbsp;depicting the insular and often absurd world of academia, burnished her&nbsp;reputation as an acerbic truth-teller, but it was with <i>A Charmed Life</i> (1955), a&nbsp;searing story of small-town infidelity, that McCarthy fully embraced the frank and&nbsp;avant-garde treatment of gender and sexuality that would inspire generations of&nbsp;readers and writers. Also included are all eight of McCarthy's short stories, four&nbsp;from her collection <i>Cast a Cold Eye</i> (1950), and four collected here for the first time.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b> is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

She graduated from Vassar College in 1933 and&nbsp;went on to work as a critic for <i>The New Republic</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, and the <i>Partisan&nbsp;Review</i>, for which she was an editor from 1937 to 1948. She married four times,&nbsp;most notably in 1938 to the critic Edmund Wilson. She is the author of seven&nbsp;novels as well as many other volumes of autobiography, travelogues, essays, and&nbsp;criticism.<br><br><b>Thomas Mallon</b>, editor,&nbsp;Thomas Mallon is the author of nine novels, including <i>Watergate</i>,<i> Finale,&nbsp;</i>and <i>Fellow Travelers, </i>as well as seven books of nonfiction. &nbsp;A prot�g� and friend of McCarthy's, he is a regular contributor to <i>The New Yorker </i>and <i>The New York Times Book Review.</i></p><h2>Basher Science: Biology: Life As We Know It</h2><p><p>Basher Science: Biology, Life As We Know It created and illustrated by Simon Basher, Written by Dan Green:</p><p>Nature's building blocks have never been more sociable than in this newest offering from the creators of The Periodic Table and Physics.

Inspired by a love of simple line work and a rich palette, his characters blend the edge of manga with the cuteness of Hello Kitty.</p>Grade 3&#x2013;8&#x2014;One page each is devoted to entries covering diverse topics from mitochondria, bacteria, and amphibians to T cells, chlorophyll, and fruit. Entries classify the item, highlight three important points, provide a sassy description, and conclude with three interesting facts. The bold and colorful Japanese-influenced graphics anthropomorphize scientific components, adding to the title's appeal for young readers or older reluctant readers trying to get a handle on the basics of biology. A lot of information, some basic and some quite advanced, is introduced, and the book is therefore a bit more unwieldy than Adrian Dingle's <i>The Periodic Table</i> (2007) and Green's <i>Physics</i> (2008, both Kingfisher). However, it is a fun, albeit brief, introduction to a vast topic.&#x2014;<i>Ragan O'Malley, Saint Ann's School, Brooklyn, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

During his professional life . . . the social sciences grew from the stage of speculative system building . . . to a more mature development in which empirical data are sought for the significance they can have for systemic theories. One reason for this breadth of influence is that much of his work concerned itself with determining the methodological and conceptual prerequisites for a mature science of human behavior.&#34; --from the Foreword to Field Theory in Social Science by Dorwin Cartwright APA is proud to reissue these two classics by Kurt Lewin, Resolving Social Conflicts and Field Theory in Social Science, in one comprehensive volume.</p><p></p><h2>Professional Baking, College Version with CD-Rom, 4th Edition</h2><p>Professional Baking contains even more expertise and formulas for the aspiring professional in this updated new Fourth Edition.

Determined not to be dull or redundant, Terry thought back to when she was stepping out into the world for the first time and the things she wished people had told her. Printing up what she thought were the most important tips for these new graduates, Terry was surprised to find that not only were these homemade pamphlets a hit with the students, but their parents clamored for copies too.<p>Now with <b>It's Ok If You're Clueless</b>, Terry McMillan brings her trademark wit and sass to every son and daughter about to take their first tentative steps into adulthood. Offering such nuggets as "Sit up straight," "Don't listen to your parents," and "Bring your laundry home," as well as "See the world" and "Read anything and everything," <b>It's Ok If You're Clueless</b> is packed with the commonsense advice and conversational tone that have made her novels classic bestsellers. Equal parts witty and wise, <b>It's Ok If You're Clueless</b> is the perfect gift for the college bound this May.</p></p><p>Terry McMillan is the critically acclaimed, award-winning author of five previous novels and recipient of the Essence Award for Excellence in Literature.<br><br><p> </p><p> </p>It's a treat to hear the often-cranky McMillan's motherly, caring side sneak out, which it does on this audiobook born of a speech she gave to son Solomon's high school graduating class. Notwithstanding Floyd's sassy sista-girl voice with a Terry-like accent, listeners familiar with McMillan's voice might feel shortchanged that she did not narrate this single disc. Otherwise, this music-free CD is perfect for a young adult attention span: short, funny, hip, yet insightful and heartfelt. After the introduction&#x2014;which explains that the speech covers what McMillan wished she'd known as a high school graduate in the class of 1969&#x2014;are 23 commonsense tips (from "Sit up straight and walk tall" to "Don't listen to your parents") to guide young adults through the confusing sea of hormones and homework, influences and inspirations. The nurturing tone only underscores how much more momentous it might have been if McMillan herself had narrated this important departure from her bestselling relationship-based fiction. And her money's where her mouth is: the introduction notes that Solomon graduated from Stanford University in last month. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These resemblances suggest that we are better off if we simply consider the Puritan colonization of New England as a continuation of Iberian models rather than a radically different colonizing experience. The book demonstrates that a wider Pan-American perspective can upset the most cherished national narratives of the United States, for it maintains that the Puritan colonization of New England was as much a chivalric, crusading act of <i>Reconquista</i> (against the Devil) as was the Spanish conquest.</p><p>In this remarkable work in Atlantic history, Jorge Ca�izares-Esguerra demonstrates with lavish scholarship and visual imagery the European settlers&#x2019; struggle with Satanic forces that permeated the colonization and settlement of Europeans, both Hispanic and British, in the Western Hemisphere. He explores the epical narratives written in Spanish, Latin, and English, of that deeply embedded struggle, and shows how Christians in America thereafter fought to preserve a spiritual &#x201c;garden&#x201d; free of demonic forces. The struggle he describes in this original and challenging book, experienced by Christians of the time as heroic and inescapable, was an essential part of Atlantic history in the years of its early development.&#x2014;Bernard Bailyn, Harvard University<br>&#x201c;Recent scholarship on early modern Europe has shown how, contrary to the sharp contrasts of historical folklore, the Protestant and Catholic Reformations dreamed comparable dreams, and promoted comparable forms of political, economic, and social development. Now Professor Ca�izares-Esguerra completes the picture for the Americas of roughly the same era; in a book notable for skillful deployment of a rich visual material, he shows how Spanish and Puritan clerics, at opposite ends of a mutual anathema, dreamed comparable dreams, and shared common fears of an advancing kingdom of the devil.&#x201d;&#x2014;James Tracy, University of MinnesotaJorge Ca�izares-Esguerra is Professor of History at the University of Texas at Austin.

She received a Masters of Fine Arts in Writing for Children from Vermont College, Union Institute and University, Montpelier, Vermont. This book is the result of helping her daughter strategize to deal with AD/HD, researching the syndrome extensively, and consulting with Dr. Joel Singerman, a pediatrician with AD/HD.Grade 7 Up - Walker covers a wide spectrum of topics to provide both technical and practical facts about AD/HD. Although the information is comprehensive, it may be too overwhelming for girls who have difficulty attacking larger tasks (like reading such a dense book). The writing style varies, but generally Walker tries to be conversational and teen-friendly. The text is written from the viewpoint of Maddy, a fictional character with AD/HD. Sprinkled throughout are "conversations" among her and two of her friends, also girls with AD/HD. Sometimes these discussions work, sometimes they don't (the voice tries hard to be cool, but may end up sounding flip). Despite the chatty tone, much of the narrative seems to target an adult audience and would make a good resource for parents, teachers, and other school staff. There are many good things about this book, but its cluttered layout makes it challenging for its intended audience.<i> - Mary Hazelton, Warren Community School and Miller Elementary School, ME</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Orend artfully combines a broad historical survey with a deep conceptual analysis as he brings the just war dialogue fully into the 21st Century. His use of case studies to show just war theory in action, as it were, is refreshingly down to earth, illuminating, and thorough. As is all of Brian Orend's work, this book is thoughtful, articulate, and honest.

In such widely acclaimed volumes as <em>The Crisis of the Aristocracy</em>, <em>The Family, Sex and Marriage in England</em> and <em>The Open Society</em>, he has shown himself to be a provocative and engaging writer as well as a master chronicler of English family life. Now, with <em>Road to Divorce</em>, Stone examines the complex ways in which English men and women have used, twisted, and defied the law to deal with marital breakdown.<br> Despite the infamous divorce of Henry VIII in 1529, Britons before the 20th century were predominantly, in Stone's words, "a non-divorcing and non-separating society." In fact, before divorce was legalized in 1857, England was the only Protestant country with virtually no avenue for divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty. Yet marriages did fail, and in <em>Road to Divorce</em>, Stone examines a goldmine of court records--in which witnesses speak freely about love, sex, adultery, and marriage--memoirs, correspondence, and popular imaginative works to reveal how lawyers and the laity coped with marital discord. Equally important, in tracing the history of divorce, Stone has discovered a way to recapture the slow, irregular, and tentative evolution of moral values concerning relations between the sexes as well as the consequent shift from concepts of patriarchy to those of sexual equality. He thus offers a privileged, indeed almost unique, insight into the interaction of the public spheres of morality, religion, and the law.<br> Written by the foremost historian of family life, <em>Road to Divorce</em> provides the first full study of a topic rich in historical interest and contemporary importance, one that offers astonishingly frank and intimate insights into our ancestors' changing views about what makes and breaks a marriage.<br></p><p>Much has been written about the history of the family and how marriages were made in England: this is the first book to tackle the problem of how, why, and on what scale they are broken.

This straightforward and readable, yet thorough, textbook focuses on the role of the contractor, taking the reader from start to finish -- from the early development stage through bidding, selection of the contractor, the construction itself, and close-out. A wide range of practical issues are explored, and frequently-asked questions answered: -- Exactly who the players are in construction and what each one does -- Why contractors should avoid some jobs, and how they get the right jobs -- What bidding is, and why the low bid isn&#39;t always the best bid -- Why different types of construction contracts carry different levels of risk -- The link between the type of contract and how the contractor gets paid -- Why cost estimates and schedules are keys to project success -- How a general contractor brings in a job on time and on budget And much more: -- Bonds, insurance, and liens --</p><p>Alison Dykstra, AIA, CSI, has been a registered architect for almost 30 years and began teaching construction management in the early 1990s. This textbook draws on her extensive professional and classroom experience, to explain the complex systems of construction management in a highly accessible way that meets the needs of both beginners and seasoned contractors.Dykstra, an architect and teacher of construction management courses, offers an introduction to managing contracted construction projects in 25 chapters.<br> Chapters 1-7 describe the construction project environment. Chapters 8-16 address the contract documents and the bidding process. Chapters 17-22 describe the actual construction of the facility. The author wraps up the book in the final three chapters that deal with payments, contract closeout, and litigation.<br> By and large, the chapters tend to address issues of the construction contract process chronologically, and this feature is helpful to the reader.<br> Additionally, each chapter contains definitions of the relevant nomenclature and a set of self-test questions. The premise of the coverage of topics is that the design of the work has already been completed, and that the actual implementation of the construction will need to be accomplished by a construction contractor. Although the book discusses project management topics such as estimating and scheduling, the thrust of the work is on contract management issues such as the bidding environment, bidding process, incremental payments, and contract-related negotiations.<br> This book is useful for students taking introductory courses in construction management at both four-year and two-year colleges.<br> Summing Up: Recommended.

Cummings.</strong></p><p>Formally fractured and yet gleefully alive and whole, E. E. Cummings&#x2019;s groundbreaking modernist poetry expanded the boundaries of language. In&nbsp;<em>A Miscellany</em>, originally released in a limited run in 1958, Cummings lent his delightfully original voice to &#x201c;a cluster of epigrams,&#x201d; a poem, three speeches from an unfinished play, and forty-nine essays&#x2015;most of them previously written for or published in magazines, anthologies, or art gallery catalogues. Seven years later, George J. Firmage&#x2015;editor of much of Cummings&#x2019;s work, including&nbsp;<em>Complete Poems</em>&#x2015;broadened the scope of this delightfully eclectic collection, adding seven more poems and essays, and many of Cummings&#x2019;s unpublished line drawings.</p><p>Together, these pieces paint a distinctive portrait of Cummings&#x2019;s eccentric, yet precise, genius. Like his poetry, Cummings&#x2019;s prose is lively; often witty, biting, and offbeat, he is an intelligent observer and critic of the modern. His essays explore everything from Cubism to the circus, equally quick to analyze his poetic contemporaries and satirize New York society. As Cummings wrote in his original foreword,&nbsp;<em>A Miscellany</em>&nbsp;contains &#x201c;a great deal of liveliness and nothing dead.&#x201d; This remains true today, more than fifty years after its original publication.</p></p><p><p><strong>E. E. Cummings</strong> (1894&#x2013;1962) was among the most influential, widely read, and revered modernist poets. He was also a playwright, a painter, and a writer of prose. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he studied at Harvard University and, during World War I, served with an ambulance corps in France. He spent three months in a French detention camp and subsequently wrote <em>The Enormous Room</em>, a highly acclaimed criticism of World War I. After the war, Cummings returned to the States and published his first collection of poetry, <em>Tulips &amp; Chimneys</em>, which was characterized by his innovative style: pushing the boundaries of language and form while discussing love, nature, and war with sensuousness and glee. He spent the rest of his life painting, writing poetry, and enjoying widespread popularity and success.</p><p><strong>George J. Firmage</strong> edited many works by Cummings, including <em>Erotic Poems</em>; <em>Complete Poems, 1904&#x2013; 1962</em>; and <em>Fairy Tales</em>.</p>&#x201c;One of America&#x2019;s great technical innovators, an iconoclastic opponent of convention, power, and hypocrisy. . . . [Cummings worked] with a memorable formal dexterity, a new way to arrange and frame experience on a page.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Stephen Dunn</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Cummings was one of the most spirited and original American writers of the 20th century.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Wall Street Journal</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In prose as much as in poetry, Cummings&#x2019;s lines are a vehicle for typographical leaps of daring, experiments with and distortions of syntax. Even at its most controlled, it is distinctively a poet&#x2019;s prose, looking to forge a new sound from language.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>San Francisco Chronicle</strong><br><br>&#x201c;[Cummings] is unsurpassed in his special field, one of the masters.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Malcolm Cowley</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Cummings is not merely the perfect acrobat or the genius carefully, yet easily and very skillfully inhabiting everything which we really are and everything which we never quite live.&nbsp; His intention is not to be serious, but to be very serious and get away with it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Louis Zukofsky, in Ezra Pound&#x2019;s magazine, <i>Exile</i></strong></p><h2>Philosophy of Law: Classic and Contemporary Readings with Commentary</h2><p>Ideal for undergraduate courses in philosophy of law, this comprehensive anthology examines such topics as the concept of law, the dispute between natural law theorists and legal positivists, the relations between law and morality, criminal responsibility and legal punishment, the rights of the individual against the state, justice and equality, and legal evidence as compared with scientific evidence. The readings have been selected from both philosophy and law journals and include classic texts, contemporary theoretical developments, and well-known recent court cases.

He is the author of numerous New York Times bestsellers, including The Two Minute Rule, The Forgotten Man, and L.A.

Stuart brings the quirky Cole to life quickly, combining his strengths (tenacity, incorruptibility, frequent flashes of humor) with his oddities (his love of the Disney artifacts that litter his office) to make a credible whole person. Other characters emerge with equal vocal skill: the enigmatic Joe Pike, Cole's muscular sidekick; a glowering Los Angeles property developer, his alcohol-impaired wife and their fragile adolescent daughter, who winds up being kidnapped by Japanese gangsters. Cole, hired to find a rare Japanese manuscript, discovers that the teenager's fate is very important to him personally forging a bond between the detective and children in peril that has become a hallmark of the series. For those who have been fans of Elvis since book one, The Monkey's Raincoat, it's good to have his early adventures around to listen to. For more recent Crais converts, this could prove an eye-opening revelation of how Cole got to be who he is.

What is the secret of their success? Two leading Japanese business experts, Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi, are the first to tie the success of Japanese companies to their ability to create new knowledge and use it to produce successful products and technologies. In <em>The Knowledge-Creating Company</em>, Nonaka and Takeuchi provide an inside look at how Japanese companies go about creating this new knowledge organizationally.<br>The authors point out that there are two types of knowledge: explicit knowledge, contained in manuals and procedures, and tacit knowledge, learned only by experience, and communicated only indirectly, through metaphor and analogy. U.S. managers focus on explicit knowledge. The Japanese, on the other hand, focus on tacit knowledge. And this, the authors argue, is the key to their success--the Japanese have learned how to transform tacit into explicit knowledge.<br><br>To explain how this is done--and illuminate Japanese business practices as they do so--the authors range from Greek philosophy to Zen Buddhism, from classical economists to modern management gurus, illustrating the theory of organizational knowledge creation with case studies drawn from such firms as Honda, Canon, Matsushita, NEC, Nissan, 3M, GE, and even the U.S. Marines. For instance, using Matsushita's development of the Home Bakery (the world's first fully automated bread-baking machine for home use), they show how tacit knowledge can be converted to explicit knowledge: when the designers couldn't perfect the dough kneading mechanism, a software programmer apprenticed herself with the master baker at Osaka International Hotel, gained a tacit understanding of kneading, and then conveyed this information to the engineers. In addition, the authors show that, to create knowledge, the best management style is neither top-down nor bottom-up, but rather what they call "middle-up-down," in which the middle managers form a bridge between the ideals of top management and the chaotic realities of the frontline.<br>As we make the turn into the 21st century, a new society is emerging. Peter Drucker calls it the "knowledge society," one that is drastically different from the "industrial society," and one in which <em>acquiring</em> and <em>applying</em> knowledge will become key competitive factors.

What sort of support do human capacities demand from the world, and how should we think about this support when we encounter differences of gender or sexuality? How should we think about each other across divisions that a legacy of injustice has created? In <em>Sex and Social Justice</em>, Martha Nussbaum delves into these questions and emerges with a distinctive conception of feminism that links feminist inquiry closely to the important progress that has been made during the past few decades in articulating theories of both national and global justice.<br>Growing out of Nussbaum's years of work with an international development agency connected with the United Nations, this collection charts a feminism that is deeply concerned with the urgent needs of women who live in hunger and illiteracy, or under unequal legal systems. Offering an internationalism informed by development economics and empirical detail, many essays take their start from the experiences of women in developing countries. Nussbaum argues for a universal account of human capacity and need, while emphasizing the essential role of knowledge of local circumstance. Further chapters take on the pursuit of social justice in the sexual sphere, exploring the issue of equal rights for lesbians and gay men.<br> Nussbaum's arguments are shaped by her work on Aristotle and the Stoics and by the modern liberal thinkers Kant and Mill. She contends that the liberal tradition of political thought holds rich resources for addressing violations of human dignity on the grounds of sex or sexuality, provided the tradition transforms itself by responsiveness to arguments concerning the social shaping of preferences and desires. She challenges liberalism to extend its tradition of equal concern to women, always keeping both agency and choice as goals. With great perception, she combines her radical feminist critique of sex relations with an interest in the possibilities of trust, sympathy, and understanding.<br><em>Sex and Social Justice</em> will interest a wide readership because of the public importance of the topics Nussbaum addresses and the generous insight she shows in dealing with these issues. Brought together for this timely collection, these essays, extensively revised where previously published, offer incisive political reflections by one of our most important living philosophers.<br></p><p><i>"Human beings have a dignity that deserves respect from laws and social institutions. This idea has many origins in many traditions; by now it is at the core of modern liberal democratic thought and practice all over the world. The idea of human dignity is usually taken to involve an idea of</i> equal <i>worth: rich and poor, rural and urban, female and male, all are equally deserving of respect, just in virtue of being human, and this respect should not be abridged on account of a characteristic that is distributed by the whims of fortune."</i><p> But in the world we live in, notes classicist and law professor Martha C. Nussbaum, gender and sexual orientation are used routinely as excuses to violate human dignity. In 15 deftly written essays that are as accessible as they are erudite, she makes a convincing argument for viewing feminism and gay-rights activism as two facets of the same movement, a movement that has legitimate roots in the writings of philosophers like Kant and Mill (as well as the ancient Greeks). Whether she's discussing issues as concrete as Colorado's attempts to pass legislation that discriminated against homosexuals and the contemporary debate over female genital mutilation, or as abstract as the social construction of desire, Nussbaum writes with a thoroughness and clarity that help the reader better to imagine a society in which true equality for <i>all</i> people could be achieved. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><br>Martha Nussbaum is Ernst Freund Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago.

It also acquired a reputation, especially in California, as a railroad that people loved to hate. This magisterial history tells the full story of the Southern Pacific for the first time, shattering myths about the company that have prevailed to this day. A landmark account, <i>Sunset Limited </i>explores the railroad's development and influence&#x2014;especially as it affected land settlement, agriculture, water policy, and the environment&#x2014;and offers a new perspective on the tremendous, often surprising, role the company played in shaping the American West.<br><br>Based on his unprecedented and extensive research into the company's historical archives, Richard Orsi finds that, contrary to conventional understanding, the Southern Pacific Company identified its corporate well-being with population growth and social and economic development in the railroad's hinterland. As he traces the complex and shifting intersections between corporate and public interest, Orsi documents the railroad's little-known promotion of land distribution, small-scale farming, scientific agriculture, and less wasteful environmental practices and policies&#x2014;including water conservation and wilderness and recreational parklands preservation.<br><br>Meticulously researched, lucidly written, and judiciously balanced, <i>Sunset Limited </i>opens a new window onto the American West in a crucial phase of its development and will forever change our perceptions of one of the largest and most important western corporations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p><p>"An extraordinary book by a master historian! Orsi demonstrates that the Southern Pacific was not simply a predatory corporation obsessed with maximizing its profits and political power; it had a strong sense of the public good and a devotion to building stable, prosperous communities. This superb book should be required reading for all historians of the West, business, and the environment." Donald J. Pisani, author of <i>Water and American Government</i><br><br> This deep and extensive examination of the Southern Pacific's development activities in California will encourage readers to look beyond the overblown rhetoric of the railroad's many political enemies and see afresh its many positive economic accomplishments as it worked to build the Twentieth-Century West. Orsi&#x2019;s presentation is as luminous as it is impressive&#x201d; Carlos Schwantes, author of <i>Going Places: Transportation Redefines the Twentieth Century West</i><br><br> This brilliantly researched and beautifully written study of one of America's greatest railroads offers wonderful insights into both transportation and Western history. Orsi places the early history of the Southern Pacific Railroad in proper focus by skillfully untangling the long-standing Octopus myth. This work deserves to be called a landmark in the field.&#x201d; H. Roger Grant, author of <i>Follow the Flag: A History of the Wabash Railroad Company </i><br><br>"<i>Sunset Limited</i> illuminates not only the workings and ambitions of the Southern Pacific railroad but teaches us a great deal about the late nineteenth and early twentieth century American West as well.

Buswell&#39;s depiction of Zen reveals a religious tradition that differs radically from the stereotype prevalent in the West. Westerners exposed to Zen through English-language materials have been offered a picture of an iconoclastic religion that is bibliophobic, institutionally subversive, aesthetically sophisticated, devoted to manual labor, and intent solely on sudden enlightenment. Its most revered teachers are depicted as torching their sacred religious icons, bullying their students into enlightenment, rejecting the value of all the scriptures of Buddhism, and even denying the worth of Zen itself. In discussing the activities of the postulants, the meditation monks, the teachers and administrators, and the support monks of Song-gwang-sa, a major Korean Buddhist monastery, Buswell challenges much of this picture. In the &#34;counterparadigm&#34; of Zen offered in the daily lives of the monks, Zen&#39;s putative iconoclasts are replaced by resolute members of a community dedicated to a methodical regimen of spiritual training. Zen&#39;s apparent bibliophobia pales to reveal contemplatives learned in classical Chinese and often having extensive experience in Buddhist seminaries. And the brash challenge allegedly made to systematizations of religion, even to Zen itself, fades before monks with strong faith in the arduous way of life they have undertaken. The author&#39;s treatment lucidly relates contemporary Zen practice to the historical development of the tradition and to Korean history more generally, and his intimate, sympatheticportrayal of the life of modern Zen monks in Korea provides an innovative and provocative look at Zen from the inside.<b>Robert E.

He is not meant to worry about speaking truth; he must create human characteristics amidst the chaos.&#x201d;&#x2015;Marcel Schwob</strong></p><p><i>Imaginary Lives</i> remains, over 120 years since its original publication in French, one of the secret keys to modern literature: under-recognized, yet a decisive influence on such writers as Apollinaire, Borges, Jarry and Artaud, and more contemporary authors such as Roberto Bola�o and Jean Echenoz. Drawing from historical influences such as Plutarch and Diogenes La�rtius, and authors more contemporary to him such as Thomas De Quincey and Walter Pater, Schwob established the genre of fictional biography with this collection: a form of narrative that championed the specificity of the individual over the generality of history, and the memorable detail of a vice over the forgettable banality of a virtue.</p><p>These 22 portraits present figures drawn from the margins of history, from Empedocles the &#x201c;Supposed God&#x201d; and Clodia the &#x201c;Licentious Matron&#x201d; to the pirate Captain Kidd and the Scottish murderers Messrs. Burke and Hare. In his quest for unique lives, Schwob also formulated an early conception of the anti-hero, and discarded historical figures in favor of their shadows. These &#x201c;imaginary lives&#x201d; thus acquaint us with the &#x201c;Hateful Poet&#x201d; Cecco Angiolieri instead of his lifelong rival, Dante Alighieri; the would-be romantic pirate Major Stede Bonnet instead of the infamous Blackbeard who would lead him to the gallows; the false confessor Nicolas Loyseleur rather than Joan of Arc whom he cruelly deceived; or the actor Gabriel Spenser in place of the better-remembered Ben Jonson who ran a sword through his lung.</p><p><b>Marcel Schwob</b> (1867&#x2013;1905) was a scholar of startling breadth and an incomparable storyteller. The secret influence on generations of writers, Schwob was as versed in the street slang of medieval thieves as he was in the poetry of Walt Whitman (whom he translated into French).</p></p><p>Marcel Schwob (1867 1905) was one of the key symbolist writers, standing in French literature alongside such names as St�phane Mallarm�, Octave Mirbeau, Andr� Gide, L�on Bloy, Jules Renard, R�my de Gourmont, and Alfred Jarry. His best-known works are Double Heart (1891), The King In The Gold Mask (1892), and Imaginary Lives (1896).

On the Latin-English side all long vowels are shown by placing a -above them. Latin nouns show the genitive singular form in bold.

Part of speech abbreviations used in the dictionary are shown in the abbreviations list (p vii). Where a word has more than one part of speech, each new part of speech is preceded by a black lozenge (*). If a Latin headword is a preposition, the case taken by the preposition comes immediately after the part of speech, in italics and in brackets.</p><p><b>era, -ae</b> f <br><b>ticklish</b> adj <br><b>thunder</b> <i>n</i> tonitrus <i>m</i> * <i>vi</i> tonare, intonare. <br><b>erga</b><i> prep (with acc)</i> towards; against.<br></p><p><b>Meanings</b></p><p>Where a word or a part of speech has only one meaning, the translation comes immediately after the part of speech. However, many words have more than one meaning. Where the context is likely to show which translation is correct, variations in meaning are simply separated by a semi-colon.

On the English-Latin side, I translations of nouns include the gender of the Latin noun in <i>italics</i>. However, sometimes a phrase is needed to show how aword is used, but in some cases a direct translation of a phrasewould be meaningless: the symbol ~ in front of a translationshows that the translation is natural English, but does not meanword for word what the Latin means. Sometimes, even anapproximate translation would not be very helpful (for placenames, for example) -- in these cases, an explanation in <i>italics </i>isgiven instead.

All during my education courses in college, I held on to my conviction that I could teach kids in a way that would make them want to learn.</p><p>My first day as a "real" teacher came as a shock. As much as I had planned and prepared, I was totally unprepared for these thirty-two sixth graders. Thirty-two kids with loud voices, high energy, and powerful wants and needs. Halfway through the morning the first rumblings began: "Who stole my pencil?!"..."Get out of my face!"..."Shut up. I'm tryin' to listen to the teacher!"</p><p>I pretended not to hear and went on with the lesson, but the eruptions continued: "Why do I have to sit next to him?"..."I don't understand what we're supposed to do."..."He punched me!"..."She started it!"</p><p>My head began to pound? The noise level in the room continued to rise. Words of "patience and understanding" died on my lips. This class needed a teacher who was in charge and in control. I heard myself saying:</p><p>"Cut it out. Nobody stole your pencil."</p><p>"You have to sit next to him because I said so."</p><p>"I don't care who started it. I want it ended. Now!"</p><p>"What do you mean you don't understand? I just explained it."</p><p>"I can't believe this class. You're acting like first graders. Will you please sit still!"</p><p>One boy ignored me. He left his seat, walked over to the sharpener, and stood there grinding his pencil to a nub. In my firmest voice I ordered, "That's enough! Sit down right now!"</p><p>"You can't make me do nothin'," he said.</p><p>"We'll talk about this after school."</p><p>"I can't stay. I ride the bus."</p><p>"Then I'll need to call your parents to get this settled."</p><p>"You can't call my parents. We don't got no phone."</p><p>By three o'clock I was exhausted. The kids burst out of the classroom and spilled out onto the streets. More power to them. They were their parents' responsibility now. I'd done my time.</p><p>I slumped in my chair and stared at the empty desks. What went wrong? Why wouldn't they listen? What did I have to do to get through to these kids?</p><p>All during those first few months of teaching, the pattern was the same. I'd start each morning with high hopes and leave every afternoon feeling overwhelmed by the drudgery and tedium of having to drag my class through the required curriculum. But worse than anything, I was turning into the kind of teacher I never wanted to be -- angry, bossy, and belittling. And my students were becoming increasingly sullen and defiant. As the term wore on, I found myself wondering how long I could last.</p><p>Jane Davis, the teacher next door, came to my rescue. The day after I poured my heart out to her, she stopped by my room and handed me her worn copy of <i>How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk.</i> "I don't know if this will help," she said, "but the skills in this book saved my sanity with my own kids at home. And they sure make a difference in my classroom!"</p><p>I thanked her, put the book in my briefcase, and forgot about it. A week later I was lying in bed nursing a cold. Idly I reached for the book and opened it. The italicized words on the first page jumped out at me.</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Direct connection between how kids feel and how they behave.<p>When kids feel right, they'll behave right.</p><p>How do we help them to feel right?</p></i><p><i>By accepting their feelings!</i></p></blockquote><p>I lay back on my pillow and closed my eyes. Did I accept my students' feelings? In my head I replayed some of the exchanges I'd had with the kids that week:</p><p></p><blockquote><i>Student:</i> I can't write.<p><i>Me:</i> That's not true.</p><p><i>Student:</i> But I can't think of anything to write about.</p><p><i>Me:</i> Yes, you can! Just quit complaining and start writing.</p><p><i>Student:</i> I hate history. Who cares what happened a hundred years ago?</p><p><i>Me:</i> You should care. It's important to know your country's history.</p><p><i>Student:</i> It's boring.</p><p><i>Me:</i> No, it isn't! If you paid attention, you'd find it interesting.</p></blockquote><p>It was ironic. I was the one who was always preaching to the children about the right of each individual to his or her opinions and feelings. Yet in practice, whenever the kids expressed their feelings, I dismissed them. Argued with them. My underlying message was "You're wrong to feel what you feel. Listen to me instead."</p><p>I sat up in bed and tried to remember. Did my teachers ever do that to me? There was that one time in high school when I was stricken over my first failing grade and my math teacher tried to give me a pep talk: "There's nothing to be upset about, Liz. It's not that you lack ability in geometry. You just haven't applied yourself. You have to make up your mind that you're going to do it. The trouble with you is, <i>your attitude is bad."</i></p><p>He was probably right, and I knew he meant well, but his words left me feeling stupid and inadequate. At one point I stopped listening and watched his mustache moving up and down and waited for him to finish so I could get away from him. Is that what my students felt about me?</p><p>Over the next few weeks I tried to respond more sensitively to my students' feelings, to reflect them accurately:</p><p><i>"It's not easy to choose a topic you want to write about."</i></p><p><i>"I hear how you feel about history. You're wondering why anyone would even care about what happened so long ago."</i></p><p>It helped. I could see immediately that the kids experienced the difference. They nodded, looked me straight in the eye, and told me more. Then one day Alex announced, "I don't want to go to gym and no one can make me!" That was enough. I didn't hesitate for a minute. In icy tones I answered, "You will go to gym or you will go to the office!"</p><p>Why was it so hard to acknowledge kids' feelings? At lunch I asked that same question aloud and told my friend Jane and the others at my table what I'd been reading and thinking about.</p><p>Maria Estes, a parent volunteer, sprang to the defense of teachers. "There are so many children to teach," she said, "and so much to teach them. How can you expect yourself to worry about every little word?"</p><p>Jane looked thoughtful. "Maybe," she said, "if the adults in our lives had worried a little about their words, we wouldn't have so much to unlearn today. Let's face it. We're products of our past. We speak to our students the way our parents and teachers spoke to us. I know, even with my own kids at home, it took me a long time to stop repeating the old script. It was a big step for me to go from <i>'That doesn't hurt. It's only a little scratch' to 'A scratch can hurt?'"</i></p><p>Ken Watson, a science teacher, looked baffled. "Am I missing something?" he asked. "I don't see that it makes much difference."</p><p>I thought hard, hoping to come up with an example that would let him experience the difference for himself. Then I heard Jane say, "Ken, imagine that you're a teenager and that you'd just made the school team -- basketball, football, whatever."</p><p>Ken smiled. "Soccer," he said.</p><p>"Okay," Jane said, nodding, "now imagine you went to your first practice session, filled with enthusiasm, and the coach called you aside and told you that you were cut from the team."</p><p>Ken groaned.</p><p>"A little later," Jane continued, "you see your homeroom teacher in the hallway and tell her what just happened. Now pretend that I'm that teacher. I'll respond to your experience in a number of different ways. Just for the heck of it, jot down what the kid inside you feels or thinks after each of my responses."</p><p>Ken grinned, took out his pen, and reached for a paper napkin to write on.</p><p>Here are the different approaches Jane tried with him:</p><p></p><blockquote><b>Denial of Feelings</b><p>"You' re getting yourself all worked up over nothing. The world isn't going to come to an end because you didn't make some team. Forget about it."</p><p><b>The Philosophical Response</b></p><p>"Life isn't always fair, but you have to learn to roll with the punches."</p><p><b>Advice</b></p><p>"You can't let these things get you down. Try out for another team."</p><p><b>Questions</b></p><p>"Why do you think you were dropped? Were the other players better than you? What are you going to do now?"</p><p><b>Defense of the Other Person</b></p><p>"Try to see it from the coach's point of view. He wants to produce a winning team. It must have been tough for him to decide who to keep and who let go."</p><p><b>Pity</b></p><p>"Oh, you poor thing. I'm so sorry for you. You tried so hard to make the team, but you just weren't good enough. Now all the other kids know. I'll bet you could just die of embarrassment."</p><p><b>Amateur Psychoanalysis</b></p><p>"Did you ever consider that the real reason you were cut from the team was that your heart wasn't in your playing? I think that on a subconscious level you didn't want to be on the team, so you messed up on purpose."</p></blockquote><p>Ken threw up his hands. "Stop! Enough. I get the idea."</p><p>I asked Ken if I could see what he had written. He tossed me the napkin. I read it aloud:</p><p>"Don't tell me how to feel."</p><p>"Don't tell me what to do."</p><p>"You'll never understand."</p><p>"You know what you can do with your questions!"</p><p>"You're taking everybody's side but mine."</p><p>"I'm a loser."</p><p>"That's the last time I'll ever tell you anything."</p><p>"Oh, dear," Mafia said. "A lot of those things that Jane just said to Ken sound like what I say to my son, Marco. So what could you do instead?"</p><p>"Acknowledge the child's distress," I answered quickly.</p><p>"How?" Maria asked.</p><p>The words wouldn't come to me. I looked to Jane for help. She turned to Ken and fixed her eyes upon him. "Ken," she said, "to find that you were cut from the team when you were so sure you were on it must have been a big shock and a big disappointment!"</p><p>Ken nodded. "It's true," he said. "It was a shock. And it was a disappointment. And frankly, it's a relief to have someone finally understand that simple fact."</p><p>We all had a lot to sa...</p></p><h2>The World of Chemistry: Essentials (Available Titles OWL)</h2><p>Joesten&#39;s WORLD OF CHEMISTRY: ESSENTIALS is known for effectively presenting chemistry in terms understandable to the non-science major.

Along with Inspector Blampignon&#x2015;an amiable policeman from Nice&#x2015;Meredith must trace the whereabouts of Chalky Cobbett, crook and forger.</p><p>Soon their interest centres on the Villa Paloma, the residence of Nesta Hedderwick, an eccentric Englishwoman, and her bohemian house guests&#x2015;among them her niece, an artist, and a playboy. Before long, it becomes evident that more than one of the occupants of the Villa Paloma has something to hide, and the stage is set for murder.</p><p>This classic crime novel from 1952 evokes all the sunlit glamour of life on the Riviera, and combines deft plotting with a dash of humour. This is the first edition to have been published in more than sixty years and follows the rediscovery of Bude's long-neglected detective writing by the British Library.</p></p><p><p><strong>JOHN BUDE</strong> was the pseudonym of Ernest Elmore (1901&#x2013;1957), an author of the golden age of crime fiction. Elmore was a cofounder of the Crime Writers' Association, and worked in the theatre as a producer and director.</p>Death on the Riviera by John Bude is a multi-branched mystery that starts out as a search for a counterfeit money maker, extends to the inhabitants of a villa in Riviera, and spawns a murder mystery and some romance along the way. Detective Inspector Meredith and Sergeant Strang have been sent from England to the French Riviera to track down an expert forger. When they arrive, they find their French counterpart, Inspector Blampignon, investigating cigarette smugglers. Working together, the three find their attention focused on the Villa Paloma and the assorted guests and residents of owner, Englishwoman Nesta Hedderwick....Bude keeps this astonishing number of cases, sometimes seeming to overlap and sometimes looking wholly separate, running smoothly. All three of the main detectives and the occasional other police investigators work with painstaking care to sort out the threads and resolve the cases. The characters vary in their depth: Meredith and Strang are the most fully developed and the rest enough to fill their roles without becoming caricatures; the most important part here is the mystery, which has enough variety to keep anyone reading. Bude plays fair with his readers: Looking backward, it is possible to track every step and clue that leads to the conclusions....Death on the Riviera is published by Poisoned Pen Press as part of their release of the British Crime Library books, rediscovered titles from the time between the wars. It has been sixty years since this book was published, and that is sixty years too long....The book is perfect for readers who love Agatha Christie but who have already read through her oeuvre, or for those who enjoy her work but want a slightly different take on the same kind of puzzle....Death on the Riviera comes out 1, 2016. Pre-order from Amazon or Powell's. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>Did I enjoy reading John Bude's Death on the Riviera?! Yes! I might even go so far as to call it a gush-worthy read? Why? Purely because I found it hard to put down, and, just overall satisfying to read. Is it the best ever mystery novel? Probably not. But was it a joy to spend time with? Yes, very much....Inspector Meredith (C.I.D) and Acting-Sergeant Freddy Strang head to Southern France in this mystery novel. They are teaming up with the local police to stop a gang of criminals from printing counterfeit money and introducing it into the currency. The prime suspect--the leader of the gang--is English. But though it is late in coming--very, very late in coming--this one is a murder mystery as well. So there are at least two 'big' stories going on in this delightful golden-age detective novel....Why did I find it so delightful? Probably for me, the number one reason is the characters and characterization as shown off so well in the dialogue. I really, really enjoyed Freddy Strang's presence in this one. And his attempted romance was just cute and sweet in all the right ways. It was never the focus of the book, but, it was like the chocolate bits in a trail mix. I also enjoyed the setting and the plot and the solution....The book was originally published in 1952, and it has been republished in 2016. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>First published in 1952, this welcome reissue in the British Library crime classics series takes Bude's Detective-Inspector Meredith of the C.I.D. and his assistant, Acting-Sergeant Freddy Strang, to the French Riviera, where they get on the trail of a counterfeiter connected with a black market money-changing scam&#x2015;and are drawn into the lives of the strange m�nage at Villa Paloma, the home of rich widow Nesta Hedderwick. There are occasional splashes of witty dialogue and luscious descriptions of the French Riviera; also, every suspect has at least one guilty secret. The mystery trots along at a good pace, although those who expect the death mentioned in the title to occur early on, as it undoubtedly would today, should relax, sit back, and enjoy the ride; you'll get there eventually. Old-fashioned English slang&#x2015;detectives "take a dekko" at the crime scene, villainous chaps are described as bad hats, and farewells call for a jaunty "cheerio"&#x2015;adds to the period charm. (Mar.) (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>This book does not have a slow part to it! It is always interesting and always mysterious. It is an intelligent mystery with puzzle pieces that won't disappoint! The characters are so eccentric and all have something to hide. And I was continually trying to figure out what each one had to hide! The French Riviera is the perfect setting to give this author a chance to show off his descriptive writing. The characters plus the setting plus just the right amount of humor made this mystery a very original and fun read. (<i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>A good old fashioned murder mystery set on the French Riviera in the 1950's....A story about an eclectic mix of both English and French and their possible involvement in murder....Another great story from the British Library reprinted for everyone to enjoy. (<i>NetGalley</i>)<br><br>I really enjoyed this book....it is full of intrigue and action. (Matthew Barnes <i>Carpe Libris</i>)<br><br>"Death on the Riviera" is a mystery novel that was originally published in 1952. The first two-thirds of the story covered the hunt for the counterfeit currency criminals. Meredith's assistant spots some vital clues while mooning over a girl. The clever detectives put two and two together and work out who and how. Just as they begin the arrests, though, one of the criminals goes missing and appears to have been killed. Another man commits suicide. Some of the evidence doesn't make sense, so the detectives keep digging until they work out what really happened....While there were clues and you can guess some things from those clues, the detectives tended to keep critical clues to themselves until they were ready to reveal how everything was done. It's a clever puzzle, though, and the characters were interesting and engaging. The romantic subplot added some fun humor....There was no sex. There was a fair amount of bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this intriguing, enjoyable mystery. (<i>GenreReviews</i>)<br><br>This is my second John Bude novel, and I am now a firm fan....He writes with a light hand, adept characterisation, and a dry sense of humour....Death on the Riviera starts with the secondment of Detective Inspector Meredith to the French Riviera where a counterfeit currency racket has been linked to an Englishman, Chalky Cobbett, a well known crook and forger....Aided by Sergeant Strang and Inspector Blampignon, Meredith follows the clues to Villa Paloma, the residence of an eccentric Englishwoman and her odd assortment of guests. There is smuggling, a clandestine love affair, a wronged husband, a cad, and, of course, a body....This is a highly enjoyable classic murder mystery. (<i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>The first trio of John Bude s mysteries were set firmly on home ground; The Cornish Coast Murder, The Lake District Murder and The Sussex Downs Murder. However, in this later novel, he turns to the more exotic location of the French Riviera. First published in 1952, Bude was, at that time, an extremely successful author and responded to the wish of a public, tired by rationing and austerity, for sunshine and glamour....Detective Inspector Meredith and Acting-Sergeant Freddy Strang are sent to the South of France to investigate a currency racket. The gang producing the counterfeit notes, which are flooding the Riviera, are said to be led by an Englishman, while "Chalky" Cobbett is rumoured to be the forger. On the way, Meredith and Strang meet Bill Dillon, who is also going to the Riviera, to visit the Villa Paloma; owned by wealthy widow, Nesta Hedderwick....This book effortlessly weaves and intertwines the stories of the counterfeit inquiry with those of the inhabitants of the Villa Paloma. For Bill Dillon's visit will lead, ultimately, to murder and both Meredith and Strang become involved the young Freddy Strang not least because he falls in love with Dilys, the niece of Mrs Hedderwick. Other members of the household include Tony Shenton, Kitty Lindon and an artist called Paul Latour, who all have their secrets....Although this novel is set in the early 1950's, it is clear that the war is all still too present not only with Bude's audience of readers, but on the scars it has physically left on the landscape. When Meredith and Strang first meet up with Bill Dillon, the men are trying to negotiate their way out of Dunkirk, with virtually all the roads destroyed and not a single road sign in evidence. Indeed, Dillon recalls being there as a soldier and those memories were all too close to most of the audience reading this book. However, although the war was touched on, what Bude gives us is an enjoyable mystery with secrets galore, some organised crime and a rather touching love story. A good read for anyone who enjoys Golden Age crime novels. (<i>Goodreads</i>)<br><br>This book is labeled as a "murder mystery," but the murder does not actually occur until about 3/4 of the way through the book. It begins with Detective Inspector Meredith and Sergeant Strang, who have been sent from Scotland Yard to the French Riviera. They are on the trail of "Chalky" Cobbett, known forger, and is suspected of running a counterfeit ring in the Riviera....The narrative moves between the counterfeit investigation, and the happenings at the Villa Paloma, home of Nesta Hedderwick and a varied crew of house guests. The story weaves the two together nicely, giving the reader background on the residents of the Villa while following the leads that Meredith turns up....For me, it is great fun to read a mystery written 60+ years ago (originally published in 1952). The motives behind the crime are typically the same as a modern mystery jealousy, greed, anger, etc. But socially, the characters behave so differently than they would in 2016. And without cell phones, DNA swabs, and the like, the detectives must rely on their investigative skills and small clues instead of our modern day technology....Mr. Bude approaches Inspector Meredith's detective work in an unusual way. Unlike Sherlock Holmes, who gathers all evidence before constructing a theory, Inspector Meredith loves to think of what might have happened, and then set off to prove if that theory is correct or not....Death on the Riviera may not be a traditional murder mystery in the sense that the murder occurs so late in the book, but it was a fun read. The mystery of the counterfeit ring and search for Chalky made this an entertaining page turner. An excellent outing in classic crime.

The journey to becoming a values-based leader starts with self-reflection. He asks, "If you are not self-reflective, how can you know yourself? If you do not know yourself, how can you lead yourself? If you cannot lead yourself, how can you lead others?" Kraemer identifies self-reflection as the first of four principles that guide leaders to make choices that honor their values and candidly recounts how these principles helped him navigate some of the toughest challenges he faced in his career. </p><ul><li>Offers a framework for adopting the principles of values-based leadership?self-reflection, balance, true self-confidence, and genuine humility?to lead organizations effectively</li><li>Based on Kraemer's popular Kellogg MBA course on values-based leadership</li><li>A recognized expert in values-based leadership, Kraemer is a sought after speaker on the subject</li></ul><p>Lively and engaging, Kraemer's book comes at a critical time when true leadership in every facet of society is desperately needed. <br><br> <strong>Q&amp;A with Harry M. Jansen Kraemer, Jr.</strong> <br> <b>Why did you write this book? </b><br> Values-based leadership has been the foundation of my leadership throughout my career. These values are rooted in the way I was raised and the lessons my parents taught me. Over the years, I have also mentored others in values-based leadership in order to increase their satisfaction and effectiveness, and to help them build a values-based team. Now, as a professor of management and strategy at Northwestern University&#x2019;s Kellogg School of Management, I teach values-based leadership. My students have encouraged me to write a book, as did many others. For me spreading the word about values-based leadership&#x2014;which is needed more than ever at this time&#x2014;is a passion and a mission. With a perceived leadership deficit in many facets of society from business to government, values-based leadership can be a powerful solution to address the need for leadership that inspires, informs, and invites followership. <br><br> <b>What makes someone a values-based leader? </b><br> Leaders influence others. Values-based leaders take it to the next level, using their words, actions, and example to inspire and motivate others to pursue what matters most. For the values-based leader, what matters most is the greater good&#x2014;the positive change that can be effected in any organization or activity whether on a local basis or a global level. Values-based leaders take the time to discover and reflect on what is most important to them, and they use their values as the basis of their decisions and actions. <br><br> <b>At what level can someone become a values-based leader? </b><br> Values-based leadership is possible for anyone to achieve&#x2014;from the college graduate starting a first job to a senior executive. Every organization&#x2014;for-profit, not-for-profit, government&#x2014;needs values-based leaders. All it takes is a desire to do the right thing by making choices and decisions that are aligned with your values. I embraced values-based leadership a long time ago when I was a junior member of a team that was working in cubicles. I never knew when or if I would be promoted out of those cubicles. No matter what, I told myself, I was committed to making a difference with my life in whatever way I could. As my career progressed, eventually becoming chairman and CEO of a $10 billion global healthcare company, I continued to follow values-based leadership, treating others with respect and never putting my own needs and desires ahead of the goals of my team or the organization. <br><br> <b>What are the principles of values-based leadership? </b><br> The four principles are: (1) self-reflection, which increases self-awareness; (2) balance, which encourages you to seek multiple perspectives to gain a global perspective; (3) true self-confidence, which helps you identify your strengths and weaknesses and to feel comfortable in your own skin; and (4) genuine humility, which keeps you from forgetting where you came from, no matter what your title or level of accomplishment. Together they form a foundation of values-based leadership. They may appear simplistic, but they are a lifelong discipline. In the book, I go into detail about what each of the principles has meant to me and how leaders at all levels can use them to embark on their own journey of values-based leadership. <br><br> <b>How do the four principles work together as a foundation for leadership? </b><br> The principles will help you lead and influence others, regardless of your level in the organization. The principles will also help you, as a values-based leader, to build a values-based organization. You will develop a team of people who are also aligned with values&#x2014;theirs and those of the organization. You will make sure the values are reflected in the organization&#x2019;s strategy, how it communicates, how it treats people, how it creates alignment, how it develops talent, and so forth. At every juncture, values are the foundation&#x2014;particularly when an organization faces change, controversy or crisis. When you know what your values are and the values that the organization stands for, making decisions even in the most difficult circumstances becomes clearer: You will do the right thing. <br></p></p><p><p>In this anticipated book, Harry Kraemer, professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management and former chairman and CEO of Baxter International, a multibillion-dollar health care company, argues that, as the global economy becomes even more competitive, organizations will turn to values-based leaders who, in doing the right thing, deliver outstanding and lasting results.</p> <p>Kraemer knows about delivering results. During his leadership at Baxter, the company experienced consistently strong growth. And Kraemer also knows about doing the right thing; not only did he step up to the plate when things were going well but also when faced with change, controversy, and crisis, as he did throughout his career. In From Values to Action, Kraemer argues that the journey to becoming a values-based leader starts with self-reflection, which he identifies as the first of four principles that guide leaders to make choices that are aligned with their values. The four essential principles are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Self-Reflection: The ability to reflect and identify what you stand for, what your values are, and what matters most.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balance and Perspective: The ability to see situations from multiple perspectives, including differing viewpoints, to gain a holistic understanding.</p> </li> <li> <p>True Self-Confidence: More than mastery of certain skills, true self-confidence enables you to accept yourself as you are, recognizing your strengths and your weaknesses, and focusing on continuous improvement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Genuine Humility: The ability never to forget who you are, to appreciate the value of each person in the organization, and to treat everyone respectfully.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Drawing from first-hand experience, Kraemer offers current and aspiring leaders a framework to adopt the four principles of values-based leadership to make their organizations beacons of enduring value in the world. Insightful and inspiring, From Values to Action comes at a critical time when true leadership in every facet of society is greatly needed.</p><p>Praise for From Values to Action</p> <p>"A worthy read for any aspiring leader. Kraemer leverages his unique collection of world-class experiences to bring the leadership journey to life in a compelling and practical fashion."&#x2014;Douglas R. Conant, president and CEO, Campbell Soup Company</p> <p>"Values-based leadership has never been more important. For anyone wanting to be a better leader, every page of Kraemer's book offers practical advice."&#x2014;Greg Case, president and CEO, Aon Corporation</p> <p>"Kraemer's engaging book takes you into the heart of genuine leadership: the practices and habits that enable leaders to be reflective, self-aware, and genuinely humble.

Caring provides us with stable ambitions and concerns; it shapes the framework of aims and interests within which we lead our lives. The most basic and essential question for a person to raise about the conduct of his or her life is not what he or she should care about but what, in fact, he or she cannot help caring about.</p><br><p> The most important form of caring, Frankfurt writes, is love, a nonvoluntary, disinterested concern for the flourishing of what is loved. Love is so important because meaningful practical reasoning must be grounded in ends that we do not seek only to attain other ends, and because it is in loving that we become bound to final ends desired for their own sakes.</p><br><p> Frankfurt argues that the purest form of love is self-love. This sounds perverse, but self-love--as distinct from self-indulgence--is at heart a disinterested concern for whatever it is that the person loves. The most elementary form of self-love is nothing more than the desire of a person to love. Insofar as this is true, self-love is simply a commitment to finding meaning in our lives.</p></p><p><b>Harry G. Frankfurt</b> is Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Princeton University.

Now, in <em>The Man Behind the Microchip</em>, Leslie Berlin captures not only this colorful individual but also the vibrant interplay of technology, business, money, politics, and culture that defines Silicon Valley.<br> Here is the life of a high-tech industry giant. The co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, Noyce co-invented the integrated circuit, the electronic heart of every modern computer, automobile, cellular telephone, advanced weapon, and video game. With access to never-before-seen documents, Berlin paints a fascinating portrait of Noyce: an ambitious and intensely competitive multimillionaire who exuded a "just folks" sort of charm, a Midwestern preacher's son who rejected organized religion but would counsel his employees to "go off and do something wonderful," a man who never looked back and sometimes paid a price for it. In addition, this vivid narrative sheds light on Noyce's friends and associates, including some of the best-known managers, venture capitalists, and creative minds in Silicon Valley. Berlin draws upon interviews with dozens of key players in modern American business--including Andy Grove, Steve Jobs, Gordon Moore, and Warren Buffett; their recollections of Noyce give readers a privileged, first-hand look inside the dynamic world of high-tech entrepreneurship.<br> A modern American success story, <em>The Man Behind the Microchip</em> illuminates the triumphs and setbacks of one of the most important inventors and entrepreneurs of our time.<br></p><p><br><strong>Leslie Berlin</strong> is Project Historian for the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford University.

Noyce's story is a fascinating one...The book succeeds best as a business biography, putting his impressive accomplishments in perspective.

The book is one of only a handful of scholarly biographies of members of the generation of inventors and entrepreneurs whobuilt the semiconductor industry and helped create the economic and cultural phenomenon now known as Silicon Valley. Berlin describes Noyce's technical accomplishments accurately and with appropriate detail, but she also makes clear that he was as much a social and economic innovator as a technical one. Berlin's portrayal of Noyce might be characterized as ironic hagiography. She celebrates his achievementsbut also makes it clear that those accomplishments came at a substantial human cost. Berlin's biography will help preserve Noyce's reputation and will serve as an important resource for future studies of Silicon Valley."--<em>American Scientist</em><p></p><br>"Few people had a greater impact on life in the second half of the 20th century than Bob Noyce, co-inventor of the integrated circuit.

Latacz, one of Korfmann's closest collaborators, traces the course of these excavations, and the renewed investigation of the imperial Hittite archives they have inspired. As he demonstrates, it is now clear that the background against which the plot of the <em>Iliad</em> is acted out is the historical reality of the thirteenth century BC. The Troy story as a whole must have arisen in this period, and we can detect traces of it in Homer's great poem.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joachim Latacz</strong> is Professor Emeritus at the University of Basel and the author of <em>Homer: His Art and His World</em>.<br><br>"Latacz's treatment of his topic is stimulating, often insightful, thought-provoking, and controversial." --<em>Near Eastern Archaeology</em><p></p><br>"Latacz not only presents new evidence for the connection between Homer and Troy, but reveals the subtle and rigorous logic ('balancing the probabilities') that, applied to new archaeological evidence, leads to these conclusions.

Chr�tien's romances became the source for Arthurian tradition and influenced countless other poets in England and on the Continent. Yet his swift-moving style is difficult to capture in translation, and today's English-speaking audiences remain largely unfamiliar with the pleasures of reading his poems. <br><br>Now an experienced translator of medieval verse who is himself a poet has translated <i>Eric and Enide</i> in an original three-stress metric verse form that fully captures the movement, the sense, and the spirit of the Old French original. Burton Raffel's rendition preserves the subtlety and charm of a poem that is in turn serious, dramatic, bawdy, merry, and satiric. <br><br><i>Erec and Enide</i> tells the story of Erec, a knight at King Arthur's court, whose retirement to domestic bliss with his beautiful new wife Enide takes him away from his chivalric duties. To regain his knightly honor, Erec sets out with Enide on a series of amazing adventures. Eric dispatches thieves and giants with prodigious strength and valor but treats his wife rather harshly for doubting his abilities. When Enide is kidnapped by a robber baron, Erec revives from near-death to perform a courageous rescue, and at length the two are reconciled. <br></p><p>"Ms. Gilbert's couplets read beautifully, encompassing Chr�tien's range of tone&#x2014;from wit to elevation of sentiment&#x2014;very sensitively."&#x2014;Charles Muscatine, author of <i>Chaucer and the French Tradition</i><br><br>"A wonderfully accurate and witty translation of Chr�tien's <i>Erec and Enide</i> which brilliantly renders the rhymed octosyllabics of the original text in compelling, colloquial English. . . .

Within seven months, roughly 200 people were arrested, 17 were hanged, and 70 others were expelled from New York. This book abridges the transcript Justice Daniel Horsmanden kept of the trials. His record of the testimony of slaves and working-class whites provides extraordinary clues to the nature of race, class, and gender relationships in colonial New York City and raises questions about the nature and extent of the alleged conspiracy. Serena Zabin&#x2019;s introduction provides context by describing slavery, tavern culture, and the legal system as well as explaining British tensions with France and Spain. Additional documents include newspaper accounts of the Antigua and Stono Rebellions and letters concerning the 1741 trials to help students make connections among these uprisings and the atmosphere of fear and suspicion they created. Document headnotes and glosses, lists of trial participants, a chronology of events, questions for consideration, a selected bibliography, and an index provide strong pedagogical support.</p><p><b>SERENA R.

Blurry and distorted, they seem to coax their subjects from mysterious spaces. --Grace Glueck, <i>The New York Times</i><br>&#x201c;Ess' images often have a dreamy subterranean quality--part wonder and part menace--as if culled directly from the subconscious.&#x201d;<br>--Gregory Volk, <i>ARTnews</i><br><i>I Am Not This Body</i> investigates primary, personal experience and relies upon the viewer's imagination and memories. Barbara Ess is renowned for her accomplished use of the pinhole camera and her effort to &#x201c;photograph what cannot be photographed.&#x201d; Ess' is a conscious quest to explore what she calls &#x201c;ambiguous perceptual boundaries: between people, between the self and the not self, between in here and out there.&#x201d; In her view, &#x201c;reality... includes a perceiver, who has memories, thoughts, desires, emotions--[which] a normal camera tends to omit.&#x201d; The strange and affecting images she coaxes from this primitive camera manage to evoke the sublime and the impossible, the textures of desire and loss.</p><p>Over the past two decades,<b> Barbara Ess</b> has been represented in numerous exhibitions, including a large retrospective of her work at the Queens Museum in 1993. She also works with video and installation.<br>This first major overview of Ess's photographic work, which also features supplemental drawings, video stills, and photographs of the artist's performances, highlights her stunning use of the pinhole camera. Large sections of uninterrupted full-page reproductions, many of which utilize brilliant hues of light and blurred images to create an otherworldly effect, capture simple frame houses, waterfalls, naked thighs, couples kissing, animals feeding, a snake in a living room, and other details of domestic and wild life. Even the images of the natural world seem to have a psychological component, which is brought to the fore in her video and performance work, as illustrated at the end of the book. In brief personal essays, writer Cunningham discusses science and the exploratory nature of Ess's art, Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore talks about Ess's participation in New York's punk/no-wave music scene, and meditation teacher Guy Armstrong takes on the topic of perception in Ess's work. The writing by Ess herself is impressionistic, complementing the work if not explaining it. A short interview and extensive bibliography highlight the depth of her career.

Collington ( Little Pickle ; The Angel and the Soldier Boy ) has chosen instead to illustrate his fanciful twist on a familiar tale with 140 pictures--each delightful on its own, and positively enchanting in sum. Having penned her letter to Santa, a girl goes to sleep on Christmas Eve--and the magic begins. A tiny fairy confiscates the letter and, finding the door key, admits a band of her winged colleagues. Using candles from the tree, they form a radiant runway for a grizzled St. Nick, who enters via the front door and ascends a candle-lit staircase. As the fairy leader checks off the items, Santa diligently unpacks the requested presents and then trudges off into gently falling snow. The muted tones and intricately lined figures imbue this holiday fantasy with a comforting, old-fashioned flavor. Like the exhausted fairy, seen in the final painting sprawled in an armchair in her tree-trunk aerie, children will believe that this holiday mission has been splendidly performed--ditto Collington's accomplishment. Ages 4-8. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Colored-pencil drawings in muted shades tell this wordless story of a little girl whose Christmas is aided by fairies as well as by Santa Claus. The dedication "to chimneyless children everywhere" justifies the helping fairies , but readers don't see that the house lacks a chimney until well into the story. A fairy tucks the girl's letter to Santa in her belt and opens the outside door to other fairies who borrow candles to light the way for Santa's sleigh to land. At the girl's bedside, Santa nearly blows his cover when he drops a gift and the sleeping girl awakes to enjoy her presents by herself, an act that some children may find very curious. While this story lacks the poignancy and excitement of Raymond Briggs' wordless classic, The Snowman (Random, 1986), it has its own quiet charm, especially for little girls who will admire the fairy's bridelike dress and the cozy tree cottage to which she returns at the story's end.<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My American Dream: A Life of Love, Family, and Food</h2><p>For decades, beloved chef Lidia Bastianich has introduced Americans to Italian food through her cookbooks, TV shows, and restaurants. Now, in <i>My American Dream,</i> she tells her own story for the very first time. Born in Pula, on the Istrian peninsula, Lidia grew up surrounded by love and security, learning the art of Italian cooking from her beloved grandmother. But when Istria was annexed by a communist regime, Lidia&#x2019;s family fled to Trieste, where they spent two years in a refugee camp waiting for visas to enter the United States. When she finally arrived in New York, Lidia soon began working in restaurants, the first step on a path that led to her becoming one of the most revered chefs and businesswomen in the country. Heartwarming, deeply personal, and powerfully inspiring, <i>My American Dream</i> is the story of Lidia&#x2019;s close-knit family and her dedication and endless passion for food.</p><p>Lidia Matticchio Bastianich is an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning Public Television host and best-selling author of eleven cookbooks and three children&#x2019;s books. She is the chef/owner of four acclaimed New York City restaurants&#x2014;Felidia, Becco, Esca, and Del Posto. With her daughter, Tanya Bastianich Manuali, she operates Lidia&#x2019;s Pittsburgh and Lidia&#x2019;s Kansas City. She runs Becco, Esca and Del Posto with her son, Joe Bastianich. She opened Eataly, the largest artisanal Italian food and wine marketplace, in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, and S�o Paulo, Brazil, with Joe and others. She is also, with Tanya, co-founder and president of Tavola Productions and has her own pasta and sauce line sold nationwide. www.lidiasitaly.com<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>Giuliana</b><br><br>Few people outside of my immediate family know this, but for the first five years of my life, my name was not Lidia, it was Giuliana. My mother had chosen this name for me as a way to remember her homeland, which was then part of the Friuli&#x2013;Venezia Giulia region of northern Italy. The Second World War had ended, and communism was coming to Pola, the small city on the southern tip of the Istrian Peninsula, overlooking the Adriatic Sea, where my family lived. The Yugoslav Partisans, who were communist-led, had fought as guerrillas against the Nazis and Fascists and had taken over the government of Yugoslavia when the Germans were defeated. As part of the 1947 Treaty of Paris, our city, and most of the Istrian Peninsula, which had become part of Italy after World War I, was given to communist Yugoslavia.<br><br>The redrawing of borders sparked a mass exodus from the area, with more than three hundred thousand people fleeing to Italy to reclaim their Italian citizenship. Many of them had deep Italian roots; they spoke Italian, and their families were Italian. Many of them migrated on to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. My parents planned to join the migration, but my mother was pregnant with me, and they knew that travel would be difficult. There was also the question of where to go once we crossed the border. Refugees were being placed in camps, and my father was not comfortable with theidea of my mother&#x2019;s giving birth and caring for an infant in such a place. They also had my three-year-old brother, Franco, to consider. The war was still raging when my mother gave birth to him in July 1944. With the collapse of Fascist Italy in 1943, the Germans occupied the city and used it as a U-boat base, making it a target for Allied bombardments. The family had no money for clothing or food, much less furniture, so my mother fashioned a <i>cassetta</i>, a wooden cradle, for little Franco from a spaghetti box marked with the word &#x201c;fragile&#x201d; on two sides, and she fitted it with a mattress of corn leaves. When he was five months old, two bombs were dropped on Pola. The minute the siren sounded, alerting residents to the bombardment, my father left the house to assume his role as driver of the fire truck for the Pola town arsenal, Cantiere Navale di Scoglio Olivi. My mother awoke to see pieces of the ceiling falling onto her baby&#x2019;s cradle, and she hurried to his side, grabbed the spaghetti boxwith Franco inside, and ran to the bomb shelter.<br><br>At the end of the war, Pola was under the Allied forces when my mother became pregnant with me. The exodus of the Italian Istrians was still open, and many of my mother&#x2019;s friends and relatives were moving to Italy, because Istria was soon to be under the Yugoslavian rule. Food was scarce, and jobs were scarcer.<br><br>Still, my mother was an Italian school teacher and had the possibility of finding a good job somewhere in Italy. Her supervisor had requested a teaching position for her in Brescia, a city at the foot of the Alps, between Milan and Venice. The position supposedly included housing, so my father loaded all of the family&#x2019;s furniture onto his truck and traveled there to set up what was going to be our new home. He was lucky he had a truck. Many of the <i>optanti</i>&#x2014;opters, people who had opted to leave Istria&#x2014;loaded their belongings, packed in crates and boxes, onto trains. Some would go toward Trieste, Italy, the Free Territory, their horse-drawn carts with piles of pots, pans, chairs, tables, and furniture as high as the carts could handle. I recall the stories that my grandmother Nonna Rosa would tell me about how some of those <i>optanti </i>had even dug up the bones of their deceased from the cemeteries and took them along in boxes. They could not bear to leave their loved ones behind. <br><br>When my father got to Brescia, he found that the promised &#x201c;apartment&#x201d; was nothing more than a single room, much too small to accommodate our growing family, and a search of the area for available housing turned up nothing suitable or affordable. My father could not bring his pregnant wife and small son there, so he returned home after one week; he still had all of our furniture loaded in the back of the truck. He told my mother the family would remain in Pola until after she gave birth.<br><br>That January, my parents went to the pier in Pola to bid farewell to friends boarding the <i>Toscana</i>, a ship full of <i>optanti</i>, for the short voyage to Italy across the Adriatic, headed for Venice and Ravenna; my mother, now eight months pregnant, was teary-eyed and shivering in a coat that barely covered her belly. One month later, on February 21, 1947, she gave birth to me at the hospital in Pola, and seven months after that, on the 15th of September, the day the provisions of the Treaty of Paris were put into place, the border between Italy and Yugoslavia was officially closed. My parents&#x2014;and Franco and I&#x2014;were now stuck in Yugoslavia.<br><br>Change came to Pola (&#x201c;Pula&#x201d; in Croatian) almost immediately under communism. The names of streets, towns, and monuments were changed to reflect the area&#x2019;s new official language. Everybody&#x2019;s last name was changed as the new documents and identification cards were issued. Ours was changed from the Italian &#x201c;Matticchio&#x201d; to the Slavic &#x201c;Motika.&#x201d; Churches across the peninsula were ordered closed. Suddenly, people weren&#x2019;t allowed to go to church or even practice religion openly. It was a sharp blow to many&#x2014;both Italian and Croatian&#x2014;who lived in the city and had practiced Catholicism for generations. My mother wanted to have me baptized, but now even that seemed out of the question.<br><br>I was only a few days old when my mother&#x2019;s younger sister, Lidia, and her husband, Emilio, walked quietly into my mother&#x2019;s hospital room one evening. Lidia had secretly arranged to have me baptized, and the priest was waiting for her at the small stone church adjacent to the elementary school where my mother taught second grade. To prevent the authorities from discovering the baptism ceremony, my aunt intended to sneak me out of the hospital, meet with the priest who would perform the baptism, and then sneak me back into the hospital, all without arousing suspicion among any of the doctors, nurses, or other staff.<br><br>Of course, I was way too young to remember anything from that night. But, according to my mother, Aunt Lidia wrapped me in a blanket and then tucked me inside a small sack she&#x2019;d brought with her to the hospital. No doubt, everyone prayed that I was quiet as she walked me out of my mother&#x2019;s hospital room and out into the cold night air. I can only imagine the anguish my mother felt, waiting for our return, and the joy she felt upon hearing her sister&#x2019;s voice declare, &#x201c;Here is your Giuliana!&#x201d;<br><br>Lidia told my mother that everything had gone off according to plan: the priest was at the church waiting when she arrived, and he performed the baptism without incident. There was just one small detail my aunt kept secret&#x2014;she had ignored my mother&#x2019;s wish to name me after her homeland, Venezia Giulia, and instead directed the priest to christen me with her own name, Lidia, and Giuliana as my middle name. On the way out of the hospital, my aunt even stopped by the records desk to list &#x201c;Lidia&#x201d; officially as my first name. She told the clerk she was there at the request of her sister Erminia, the mother of the child, and the woman happily obliged.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t until my mother went to the city hall in Pola to obtain a copy of my birth certificate so she could register me for the first grade that she learned the truth. A clerk told her that there was no record of a &#x201c;Giuliana Matticchio&#x201d; born on February 21, 1947. &#x201c;I have another baby girl Matticchio born to Vittorio and Erminia Matticchio <i>Motika</i> on that date, but her name is Lidia-Giuliana.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Giuliana&#x201d; had a deep meaning for my mother. Friuli&#x2013;Venezia Giulia is still a region of Italy, and Istria before the war was part of that region. Istria was in the Giulia part of the region, and we were Giuliani, as the emigrants from this area were referred to.<br><br>In one of my life&#x2019;s more unusual twists, the switch to communist rule allowed my aunt to change my name. For the first five years of my life, I was known as Giuliana by everyone who knew me&#x2014;friends, family, and everyone in town. I <i>was</i> Giuliana. Then, suddenly, I wasn&#x2019;t. Suddenly, I was Lidia.<br><br>In school, I had to go by the name shown on my birth certificate&#x2014;Lidia. My teachers and fellow students all called me Lidia, a name that I associated with my aunt, but certainly not with me.<br><br>It was as if I was being asked to play two roles in life: Giuliana at home and Lidia at school. At first, I didn&#x2019;t even respond to the name Lidia and wondered whom people were calling. Eventually, I got used to responding to both names, much like some people respond to both their given name and a nickname.<br><br>My grandmother never really embraced my new name, and to this day, my mother and my brother still jump back and forth between the two, sometimes calling me Lidia but most of the time Giuliana. No matter what name people used, I remained true to myself. Deep down inside, I was still Giuliana from Pola, even if people called me Lidia. Over time, I learned to embrace both. It wouldn&#x2019;t be the last time that I had to find a way to embrace more than one &#x201c;me.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>Life in Yugoslavia under the rule of Marshal Josip Broz Tito was not easy for the ethnic Italians who remained, my family included. My parents were watched closely by UDBA, the secret police. My mother was tutored and forced to teach all of her classes in Croatian; she was also expected to indoctrinate all of the young and impressionable children in her classes on the new communist order. From a rather prosperous lifestyle under Italian rule, everything shifted to stringent living conditions under communist rule.<br><br>My time as a young child was divided between two very different settings. One was in the city of Pola, where I lived with my parents and brother in a beautiful house with parquet floors, a tiled kitchen, and a bathroom with its own water heater, a luxury back then, and a claw-foot tub. The other was Grandmother Rosa&#x2019;s home, three kilometers or about two miles away, in sleepy Busoler, a tiny village with just thirty homes along one narrow white stone road. Most of the people in Busoler were farmers, and my grandmother tended goats, pigs, and rabbits. She also labored over a large garden, which provided much of the food for my family.<br><br>In Pola, my parents owned half of a two-family house in a fashionable area of the city. It was spacious, with a living room, dining room, two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom, with long hallways connecting some of the rooms.<br><br>The entire family was careful to protect the parquet wood floors from nicks and scuffs. We&#x2019;d make <i>le pattine</i>, sliders, that allowed us to move&#x2014;slide, actually&#x2014;from room to room without worrying. They were sewn together in the shape of a large sole from pieces of old blankets or tattered clothes. We&#x2019;d step on them and slide with the fabric under our shoes to prevent scuffing. As an extra benefit, they helped shine the floors, too.<br><br>My brother and I always had fun stepping on the sliders and racing down the long hallway leading into the kitchen. We&#x2019;d get a running start, then slide the rest of the way and sometimes fall. Once, things didn&#x2019;t go quite as planned, and both of us wound up in trouble for the broken door glass in our wake.<br><br>My family shared the yard behind the house with the family that rented the other apartment in our house. My mother tended a small garden there, though she didn&#x2019;t grow much&#x2014;at least not in comparison with my grandmother&#x2019;s garden. I remember two apricot trees, a walnut tree, a large fig tree, a small peach tree, and a loquat tree. I had a pet turtle I called &#x201c;<i>la mia tartaruga</i>,&#x201d; my little turtle, who would resurface every spring. She loved the apricots&#x2014;and, yes, it was a she, because she laid eggs every season and would bury them underground. But there was no male turtle to fertilize them, and year after year she would resurface alone. I also had a black-and-white cat named Micia. I played with my pets during the school days, when I was not with Grandma Rosa in Busoler. We also had a cantina, or cellar, where my father stored his tools, and a laundry room with a cauldron that we filled with water and heated to wash our clothes. The windows at the back of the house overlooked the playground of my nursery school, which I attended when I was four. Sometimes I&#x2019;d get homesick at school and miss my mother. During recess, I&#x2019;d stand in the playground and stare up at the windows of our house and cry, wishing she would come pick me up. Today the two-story building sports a fresh coat of deep burgundy paint and a new number 7 by the front door. But otherwise the building looks unchanged.</p><h2>Manic-Depressive Illness: Bipolar Disorders and Recurrent Depression, Vol. 1, 2nd Edition</h2><p>The revolution in psychiatry that began in the 1950s led to dramatic advances in the understanding and treatment of manic-depressive illness, also known as bipolar disorder. No other mental illness has been the subject of such extensive, clinically useful, and scientifically productive research. Hailed as the most outstanding book in the biomedical sciences when it was originally published in 1990, Manic-Depressive Illness was the first to survey this massive body of evidence comprehensively and to assess its meaning for both clinician and scientist. It also vividly portrayed the experience of manic-depressive illness from the perspective of patients, their doctors, and researchers. In this magisterial second edition, Drs. Frederick Goodwin and Kay Redfield Jamison, with the assistance of a select team of other leading scientists in the field, exhaustively review the biological and genetic literature that has dominated the field in recent years and incorporate cutting-edge research con</p><p>Frederick Goodwin is Research Professor of Psychiatry at the George Washington University Medical Center.

When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here. "'What is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures?'" What indeed? (All ages)Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>Lessons from the Greatest Stock Traders of All Time</h2><p><p><b>The trading strategies of legends Jesse Livermore, Bernard Baruch, Gerald Loeb, and more provide ways to triumph in the market</b></p> <p>Today's bookshelves are so laden with Johnny-come-lately experts, eager to sell their knowledge to any and all, that it's sometimes hard for traders to know which way to turn or whom to trust. <i>Lessons from the Greatest Stock Traders of All Time</i> makes the choice simple, examining the careers of five traders--Jesse Livermore, Bernard Baruch, Gerald Loeb, Nicolas Darvas, and Bill O'Neil--who, more than any others over the past century, demonstrated tremendous success at conquering Wall Street.</p> <p>This technique-filled book presents numerous ways in which the timeless strategies of these investing icons can be used to tame today's high-speed, unforgiving marketplaces.

Economists assured us that the calamities that befell our grandparents could not happen again, yet the recent economic meltdown has once again riveted the world&#x2019;s attention on the 1930s.<br><br> Now, in this timely and long-awaited cultural history, Morris Dickstein, whom Norman Mailer called &#x201c;one of our best and most distinguished critics of American literature,&#x201d; explores the anxiety and hope, the despair and surprising optimism of a traumatized nation. Dickstein&#x2019;s fascination springs from his own childhood, from a father who feared a pink slip every Friday and from his own love of the more exuberant side of the era: zany screwball comedies, witty musicals, and the lubricious choreography of Busby Berkeley. Whether analyzing the influence of film, design, literature, theater, or music, Dickstein lyrically demonstrates how the arts were then so integral to the fabric of American society.<br><br> While any lover of American literature knows Fitzgerald and Steinbeck, Dickstein also reclaims the lives of other novelists whose work offers enduring insights. Nathanael West saw Los Angeles as a vast dream dump, a Sargasso Sea of tawdry longing that exposed the pinched and disappointed lives of ordinary people, while Erskine Caldwell, his books <em>Tobacco Road</em> and <em>God&#x2019;s Little Acre</em> festooned with lurid covers, provided the most graphic portrayal of rural destitution in the 1930s. Dickstein also immerses us in the visions of Zora Neale Hurston and Henry Roth, only later recognized for their literary masterpieces.<br><br> Just as Dickstein radically transforms our understanding of Depression literature, he explodes the prevailing myths that 1930s musicals and movies were merely escapist. Whether describing the undertone of sadness that lurks just below the surface of Cole Porter&#x2019;s bubbly world or stressing the darker side of Capra&#x2019;s wildly popular films, he shows how they delivered a catharsis of pain and an evangel of hope. Dickstein suggests that the tragic and comic worlds of Broadway and Hollywood preserved a radiance and energy that became a bastion against social suffering. <em>Dancing in the Dark</em> describes how FDR&#x2019;s administration recognized the critical role that the arts could play in enabling &#x201c;the helpless to become hopeful, the victims to become agents.&#x201d; Along with the WPA, the photography unit of the FSA represented a historic partnership between government and art, and the photographers, among them Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange, created the defining look of the period.<br><br> The symbolic end to this cultural flowering came finally with the New York World&#x2019;s Fair of 1939&#x2013;40, a collective event that presented a vision of the future as a utopia of streamlined modernity and, at long last, consumer abundance. Retrieving the stories of an entire generation of performers and writers, <em>Dancing in the Dark</em> shows how a rich, panoramic culture both exposed and helped alleviate the national trauma. This luminous work is a monumental study of one of America&#x2019;s most remarkable artistic periods. 24 illustrations</p><p>Morris Dickstein is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of English and Theatre at the CUNY Graduate Center and the author of Dancing in the Dark, an award-winning cultural history of the Great Depression, and Why Not Say What Happened, a memoir. He lives in New York CityThe title refers to a Depression-era song that captured the zeitgeist of the New Deal society and culture. Focusing on the milieu of the 1930s, an art critic dwells on the enormous effect poverty and hopelessness made on American arts: films, novels, theater, and music. Dickstein provides examples from hundreds of sources, making peripatetic leaps through time as he pontificates. Narrator Malcolm Hillgartner inflects the narrative by nearly yelling at times and then dropping to a level that is barely audible. He does a Yiddish accent and reads complete lines of the language. After warming to Hillgartner&#39;s turgid style, listeners may come to agree that he aptly reproduces the aesthetic changes Dickstein discusses in his gloomy Steinbeck-like portrayals of life and penury.

The authors have all been test managers and software development managers at well-known Silicon Valley software companies. Successful consumer software companies have learned how to produce high-quality products under tight time and budget constraints. The book explains the testing side of that success.<br> <br> Who this book is for:<br> * Testers and Test Managers<br> * Project Managers-Understand the timeline, depth of investigation, and quality of communication to hold testers accountable for.<br> * Programmers-Gain insight into the sources of errors in your code, understand what tests your work will have to pass, and why testers do the things they do.<br> * Students-Train for an entry-level position in software development.<br> <br> What you will learn:<br> * How to find important bugs quickly<br> * How to describe software errors clearly<br> * How to create a testing plan with a minimum of paperwork<br> * How to design and use a bug-tracking system<br> * Where testing fits in the product development process<br> * How to test products that will be translated into other languages<br> * How to test for compatibility with devices, such as printers<br> * What laws apply to software quality</p><p>The original printing of <i>Testing Computer Software</i> set the standard for the emerging field of test engineering with a full tour of the state of the art in managing the testing process. The reissued text makes this classic out-of-print text available once again. Though it relies heavily on older examples (including MS-DOS) and has not been updated, this text is still a worthwhile resource for practical-minded advice on the realities of testing.<p> The best thing about <i>Testing Computer Software</i> is its practical point-by-point guide to everyday software testing, from creating a test plan, to writing effective bug reports, to working with programming staff and management to fix bugs.</p><p> That said, this book's early frame of reference shows how far we've come. (The book relies heavily on MS-DOS examples and features some truly embarrassing anachronisms, including the mention of testing dot-matrix printers and even EGA/VGA video modes.) The bibliography stops at sources from 1992 and features many references from the 1980s. Nowadays, automated software testing tools are the staple of any testing strategy. This book even advocates a wait-and-see approach to the "new" Microsoft Test.</p><p> These limitations aside, there is still a good deal to mine here. Much of the approach to testing is still very valid for any aspiring or working test engineer. Clearly, readers of the first edition will have little reason to upgrade to this second edition, but for anyone who appreciates a "classic" (and indeed a pioneering) text in the field of software testing, it's good to have <i>Testing Computer Software</i> in print again. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: test case design, test planning, project lifecycle overview, software errors, boundary conditions, bug reports, regression testing, black box testing, software quality and reliability, managing test teams, printer testing, internationalization, and managing legal risk.</p>CEM KANER consults on technical and software development management issues and teaches about software testing at local universities and at several software companies.

RUDDIMAN retired from the University of Virginia at an early age and has since devoted his time to research, writing, and lecturing. He has written trade books and numerous journal articles. While at Virginia, he taught an introductory climate course on a regular basis, therefore much of the work in the book reflects lessons learned through his own experiences.</p><h2>Carmilla</h2><p>An early Gothic vampire novel.</p><p>Joseph Thomas Sheridan Le Fanu (28 August 1814 &#x2013; 7 February 1873) was an Irish writer of Gothic tales and mystery novels. He was the leading ghost-story writer of the nineteenth century and was central to the development of the genre in the Victorian era. M. R. James described Le Fanu as "absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories". Three of his best-known works are Uncle Silas, Carmilla and The House by the Churchyard.The appearance of a young and beautiful houseguest jolts young Laura into remembering what may or may not have been a childhood nightmare. Strangely, her visitor, Carmilla, has exactly the same recollection. As Laura's health wanes throughout the visit, Carmilla's vivacity grows. Who would guess she's been dead for over 150 years? Megan Follows's dark and dramatic reading of this vampire classic complements the text perfectly. Refraining from characterization, she recounts Le Fanu's tale from Laura's horrified perspective, vividly illuminating her early relationship with Carmilla, colored by the clarity of retrospection, as the story is recalled later in Laura's life. Follows's voice shudders with disgust at Carmilla's evil, as do her listeners.

Judging from the evidence in <i>Dark Carnival: The Secret World of Tod Browning: Hollywood's Master of the Macabre</i>, this probably wouldn't have mattered to him. Authors David J. Skal (<i>Screams of Reason</i> and <i>The Monster Show</i>) and Elias Savada faced a difficult task in recounting the life of a man who "reveled in disturbing and provoking the public ... from a position of obsessive privacy," apparently caring nothing for posterity or even his reputation during his lifetime. Because Browning chose to reveal so little of his private self, any biography of him must by default focus on his career--which is itself strange and unsettling. <p> As a filmmaker, Browning established a reputation as a teller of pessimistic, even perverse tales, often featuring physically deformed characters (Chaney's specialty), which doubtless reflected his youthful experiences performing in carnival sideshows. Following the enormous success of <i>Dracula</i>, he assembled a cast of real sideshow performers to make <i>Freaks</i>, which appalled nearly everyone and was quickly removed from circulation. He soon found himself being quietly pushed out of filmmaking, and spent his final years leading a reclusive, slightly paranoid existence.</p><p> Readers of <i>Dark Carnival</i> should not expect to come away with a very clear picture of the intentionally shadowy Browning. Skal and Savada do an admirable job of showing us both the demanding "sadist" and the "great humanist" described by his colleagues, but for the most part, Browning's own thoughts and feelings must remain mysterious--which is just what he wanted. <i>Dark Carnival</i> includes photo sections, a genealogy, and filmographies that incorporate contemporary reviews. <i>--Mary V.

Josiah Ober seeks the answer by analyzing the sociology of Athenian politics and the nature of communication between elite and nonelite citizens. After a preliminary survey of the development of the Athenian "constitution," he focuses on the role of political and legal rhetoric. As jurymen and Assemblymen, the citizen masses of Athens retained important powers, and elite Athenian politicians and litigants needed to address these large bodies of ordinary citizens in terms understandable and acceptable to the audience. This book probes the social strategies behind the rhetorical tactics employed by elite speakers.</p><br><p> A close reading of the speeches exposes both egalitarian and elitist elements in Athenian popular ideology. Ober demonstrates that the vocabulary of public speech constituted a democratic discourse that allowed the Athenians to resolve contradictions between the ideal of political equality and the reality of social inequality. His radical reevaluation of leadership and political power in classical Athens restores key elements of the social and ideological context of the first western democracy.</p></p><p>First, the book is meant to be a contribution to Greek history: an attempt to explain the social roots and internal functioning of the political system of an ancient city-state. I hope that many of those who consider the history and culture of fifth-and fourth-century Athens intrinsically interesting, as I do, will find this study valuable in formulating or reformulating their own assessments of classical Greece.</p><h2>Spill Zone Book 1 (Spill Zone, 1)</h2><p><p><b>Do you dare enter the Spill Zone?

They could hardly have been more wrong. The past century has seen the rise of quantum mechanics, relativity, cosmology, particle physics, and solid-state physics, among other fields. These subjects have fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and matter. They have also transformed daily life, inspiring a technological revolution that has included the development of radio, television, lasers, nuclear power, and computers. In <i>Quantum Generations</i>, Helge Kragh, one of the world's leading historians of physics, presents a sweeping account of these extraordinary achievements of the past one hundred years.</p><br><p> The first comprehensive one-volume history of twentieth-century physics, the book takes us from the discovery of X rays in the mid-1890s to superstring theory in the 1990s. Unlike most previous histories of physics, written either from a scientific perspective or from a social and institutional perspective, <i>Quantum Generations</i> combines both approaches. Kragh writes about pure science with the expertise of a trained physicist, while keeping the content accessible to nonspecialists and paying careful attention to practical uses of science, ranging from compact disks to bombs. As a historian, Kragh skillfully outlines the social and economic contexts that have shaped the field in the twentieth century. He writes, for example, about the impact of the two world wars, the fate of physics under Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, the role of military research, the emerging leadership of the United States, and the backlash against science that began in the 1960s. He also shows how the revolutionary discoveries of scientists ranging from Einstein, Planck, and Bohr to Stephen Hawking have been built on the great traditions of earlier centuries.</p><br><p> Combining a mastery of detail with a sure sense of the broad contours of historical change, Kragh has written a fitting tribute to the scientists who have played such a decisive role in the making of the modern world.</p></p><p>We've seen our most fundamental beliefs about the nature of the universe change so many times over the past century that it's almost old hat. Danish science historian Helge Kragh looks at these revolutions and their effects in <i>Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century</i>. This well-told series of interlocking stories skillfully blends hard science with biography; Kragh intends to reach a broad audience and succeeds in maintaining interest on all levels. Starting in the 10 years before 1900, he shows us that the state of physics was not as moribund as textbooks would have us believe--in fact, much of the groundwork for the revelations of relativity and quantum mechanics was laid then. Moving along through the highlights of the past hundred years, we read of Heisenberg, Lorentz, Feynman, and many more scientists building on their predecessors' work.<p> Only the most pathologically math-phobic need fear this book; Kragh has done nonphysicists a favor by restricting his scientific discussions to terms understandable by most well-informed readers. Though he does neglect certain important fields (e.g., optics and materials science), the cohesion and relative brevity resulting from this decision make for a better book. Whether you have an abiding interest in the roots of modern physics or want to learn more about recent developments in unification theories, you'll find <i>Quantum Generations</i> a pleasant yet challenging review. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><p>"Helge Kragh's book is a magnificent achievement. It is a rich, erudite history of physics from the end of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth that is also informative and insightful about social, cultural, political, and institutional contexts. Kragh has included developments at the physics-applied physics-technology interface and has thus given an unusually comprehensive and balanced account of twentieth-century physics. What is equally impressive is that the book is readily accessible to the general reader and will also be valued by scientists and historians."--<b>S.S. Schweber, author of <i>QED and the Men Who Made It: Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga</i></b></p><p>"This book will come to be seen as an indispensable reference for those who seek a full understanding of its topic--which, of course, is one of the most important topics in modern history."--<b>Spencer R. Weart, American Institute of Physics</b></p><p>"Kragh has succeeded in presenting an engaging and comprehensive history of the development of physics in this century, one that will be accessible to a wide audience. This book will surely become a standard reference for students of twentieth-century science."--<b>Ronald Anderson, Boston College</b></p></p><h2>Spectrums: Our Mind-boggling Universe from Infinitesimal to Infinity</h2><p>From the author of <i>The Joy of Pi</i> and <i>The Flying Book</i>, an engaging new guide to the amazing unseen world around us.<br><br>How can we understand the world of the atom or the size of our galaxy?

Altogether, more than 12 million copies of the two novels have been sold in the United States. The books have attracted three generations of readers, shaped the foundation of the Libertarian movement, and influenced White House economic policies throughout the Reagan years and beyond. A passionate advocate of laissez-faire capitalism and individual rights, Rand remains a powerful force in the political perceptions of Americans today. Yet twenty-five years after her death, her readers know little about her life.<br><br>In this seminal biography, Anne C. Heller traces the controversial author&#x2019;s life from her childhood in Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution to her years as a screenwriter in Hollywood, the publication of her blockbuster novels, and the rise and fall of the cult that formed around her in the 1950s and 1960s. Throughout, Heller reveals previously unknown facts about Rand&#x2019;s history and looks at Rand with new research and a fresh perspective. <br><br>Based on original research in Russia, dozens of interviews with Rand&#x2019;s acquaintances and former acolytes, and previously unexamined archives of tapes and letters, AYN RAND AND THE WORLD SHE MADE is a comprehensive and eye-opening portrait of one of the most significant and improbable figures of the twentieth century.</p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with Anne C. Heller</strong> <br> <p> <b>Question:</b> Many people discover Ayn Rand&#x2019;s novels <i>The Fountainhead</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> as young adults, but you read her novels and essays in your forties. What, at that time, sparked your interest in Rand? What moved you to write her biography?</p> <p><b>Anne C. Heller:</b> It's true that I didn&#x2019;t read Ayn Rand&#x2019;s popular novels in high school or college. I read them for the first time seven or eight years ago, while I was editing a trial issue of a new financial magazine at Cond� Nast Publications. Suze Orman--the personal-finance author, who was contributing an article to the magazine--sent me a copy of the well-known "money speech" from <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. In the novel, the speech is delivered by a young copper baron to an assembled crowd of liberal bureaucrats and corporate welfare-statists. He argues that money, far from being the root of all evil, as the liberals in the novel pretend to think, is really "the root of all good," and "the barometer of a society&#x2019;s virtue." The speech surprised me with its passion and seemingly air-tight logic and aroused my curiosity. So I read the books.</p> <p>At that time, Rand and her work weren&#x2019;t in the news, as they are now. Once I had finished <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> for the second time, I looked around to see what had been written about her. Later, I learned that the novels were still selling in the hundreds of thousands of copies every year and that she was influential among libertarians and certain conservatives; yet no full-scale, impartial biography of this extraordinary woman had been written. Only former disciples and detractors had published books about her. The time seemed right to take a fresh approach. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> Do you think your experience with her work, philosophy, and life was different from those who read her in their adolescence?</p> <p><b>Anne C. Heller:</b> Yes. I appreciated Rand&#x2019;s insights into the nature of power and her spectacular ability to integrate plot, character, and theme more than I might have when younger. And, I was less susceptible to her romantic celebration of heroic achievement.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> <i>Ayn Rand and the World She Made</i> is the first objective, investigative biography of Ayn Rand. What new sources did you use for your research? Did you travel for your research?</p> <p><b>Anne C. Heller:</b> The only other biography was written in the 1980s by Barbara Branden, who was Rand&#x2019;s friend and disciple as well as her young lover&#x2019;s former wife. The book was partly in the form of a memoir and was also based on limited information; for example, Rand was born and educated in Russia, but at that time the Russian archives were closed. Thus Branden had to take Rand&#x2019;s word for most of the events of her childhood. I used a Russian research team to gather new details of Rand&#x2019;s family background, her parents&#x2019; professional lives, and her schooling up to and throughout her university studies, some of which contradicted what Rand had said about herself. I used published and unpublished letters and hundreds of hours of taped, unpublished interviews to document many episodes in Rand&#x2019;s life that she never talked about, including influences she buried and help she later denied.</p> <p>I traveled all over the United States to work in relevant archives and to conduct interviews with her former friends and followers, many now in their eighties and nineties, who spoke surprisingly candidly about her capacity for cruelty as well as her genius and personal magnetism. I had three lengthy interviews with her long-time lover, Nathaniel Branden, now eighty, and spoke with most members of what used to be called the "inner circle" of her cult following. I also had access to interviews with her elderly Russian sister and with close friends from the 1920s and 1930s, all now deceased. </p> <p><b>Question:</b> What surprised you most?</p> <p><b>Anne C. Heller:</b> I was surprised by many things--by how deeply her hostility to liberal social programs was rooted in her Russian childhood, by her remarkable insight into the psychology of envy and mediocrity, by her personal courage, and by her unfailing ability to spot a flaw in any opposing argument. I was also surprised to discover that many of her former followers, though personally damaged by her temper and her moral absolutism, remembered her as the most important and beneficent person in their lives. They had been wounded by her and yet loved her and were protective of her memory and legend.</p> <p><b>Question:</b> Why does Rand remain a bestseller? </p> <p><b>Anne C. Heller:</b> She certainly does remain popular. In a 1991 poll, sponsored by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club, Americans named <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> the book that had most influenced their lives after the Bible. In a separate 1998 poll by Modern Library, readers chose <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> and <i>The Fountainhead</i> as number one and two on a list of the one hundred greatest novels of the twentieth century, and Rand&#x2019;s other two novels, <i>Anthem</i> and <i>We the Living</i>, placed seventh and eighth on the list. Combined, more than twelve million copies of her two best-known novels have been sold in the U.S. alone, and sales this year have reached an all-time high.</p> <p>Like Holden Caulfield and Huckleberry Finn, Rand&#x2019;s fictional heroes strike each new generation as timelessly American in their self-reliance and revolt against timidity and conformity. And her passionate, brainy arguments on behalf of limited government and unfettered individual rights strike a strong chord, especially in times of economic trouble and increased government activism. </p> <p> (Photo � Brennan Cavanaugh) </p>ANNE C.

Noticed the way Keelie watched Andrew from the corner of her eye as she lifted her leg onto the ramp rail- ing in a perfect stretch. Sweat glistening between cleavage that even I didn&#x2019;t have. It was sweltering out; Keelie was twelve&nbsp;going on twenty, staring at a seventeen-year-old boy like he was a Popsicle.<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re drinking wine coolers,&#x201d; Lauren says. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I wasn&#x2019;t invited.&#x201d;<br> I think of the American Girl dolls still set up in Lauren&#x2019;s room, arranged around a tea set like they&#x2019;re waiting for a party that&#x2019;s never going to happen. I know she won&#x2019;t play with them because the girls at school have already packed theirs up and put them in the attic.<br> Those girls are thirteen and drinking. I should call Emma&#x2019;s house and tell her mother what&#x2019;s going on in that bedroom. Then I remember the things that went on in my house when I was thirteen.<br> &#x201c;Do you want me to block Keelie&#x2019;s number from your phone?&#x201d; I ask Lauren.<br> She shakes her head, sending a tear down her cheek. &#x201c;I just really wish I was there.&#x201d;<br> I&#x2019;m about to tell her <i>fuck Keelie March and those other dumb girls, you have me, </i>when headlights flash through my bedroom window. My room faces Sparrow Road, the outer edge of our cul-de-sac. It&#x2019;s what Bailey and Jade branded the perfect loading spot for a sneak-out. And it seems that despite my texts, they came anyway.<br> Bailey flashes her high beams; then there&#x2019;s darkness. Lauren frowns. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Just Bailey and Jade,&#x201d; I answer, fumbling for my phone. I&#x2019;ll tell them Lauren is awake. I definitely can&#x2019;t come out now.<br> &#x201c;Are you guys going somewhere?&#x201d; I hear the hopeful lilt in her voice.&#x201c;No&#x2014;we were just&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> Snow crunching outside my window. Bailey&#x2019;s face, illuminated by the light from the phone under her chin. She makes a ghostlike <i>bwahahaha </i>noise and I jump, even though I&#x2019;m looking right at her. Jade appears next to her. Adjusts the messy bun sitting atop her head and taps on my window with one finger.<br> I dart over and raise the glass. Bailey mashes her face against the screen, makes a pig nose. &#x201c;Ready to go?&#x201d; she whispers.<br> I cringe. Even when Bailey whispers, she&#x2019;s loud.<br> I think of nosy Mrs. Lao next door, probably perched in the armchair by her living room window with a Sudoku book. A small wooded clearing separates us from the Laos, but in the winter, when the trees are bare, the slightest noise from our house is enough to send Mrs. Lao&#x2019;s Yorkie, Jerome, into a bark- ing fit.<br> Jade notices Lauren sitting on my bed before Bailey does. She nudges Bailey and flicks her eyes to me, as if to say, <i>What the hell is she doing here?</i></p><h2>Practical Radiology: A Symptom-Based Approach</h2><p><ul><br> <li>Chapters are organized by a <strong>symptoms-based approach</strong> within each <strong>major body system.</strong></li><br> <li>Coverage features <strong>imaging modalities,</strong> including <strong>conventional radiology</strong>, <strong>CT</strong>, <strong>MRI</strong>, <strong>ultrasound</strong>, and <strong>nuclear medicine scans.</strong></li><br> <li><strong>Bulleted lists</strong> make<strong> key points</strong> of <strong>requesting</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>interpreting</strong> <strong>an imaging study</strong> easy to review.</li><br> <li><strong>Case studies</strong> in each chapter <strong>help you recognize imaging techniques and how to use radiologic reports to manage patient care. </strong></li><br> <li><strong>&#x201c;Cost-Effective Medicine&#x201d;</strong>&nbsp;boxes provide students with relevant insight into the economics of actual practice.</li><br> <li><strong>Clear</strong> and <strong>easy-to-understand radiographs </strong>with <strong>explanatory captions </strong>provide basic information about each image.</li><br> <li><strong>Full-color, crystal-clear images</strong> with <strong>precise labeling</strong> help you identify and interpret normal and pathologic structures and conditions.</li><br> <li><strong>Glossary</strong> in each chapter defines terms commonly found in radiology reports.</li><br></ul></p><p></p><h2>Think Good - Feel Good: A Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Workbook for Children and Young People</h2><p><i>Think Good &#x2014; Feel Good</i> is an exciting and pioneering new practical resource in print and on the internet for undertaking CBT with children and young people.

It provides a solid and thorough foundation in the aesthetic and practical basics of this all-pervasive subject, with many quotations from artists past and present on the subtleties of their techniques. The material on new technologies has been reorganized abd updated so that pigment mixtures are now explored before light mixtures.</p><p>This text provides an introduction to the many different approaches to understanding color, including aesthetics, science, and psychology.<p> Color is addressed to artists and art students in all media, in both fine and applied arts. It provides an informative but non-dogmatic introduction to the many different approaches to understanding color, including aesthetics, science, psychology, and history. Illustrations for the chapters on color concepts are taken from all media. Special aesthetic and practical considerations for color usage in each medium&#x2014;such as ways that graphic designers use and specify printers' inks&#x2014;are also explored. The realities of color use are accentuated by direct quotes from working artists. Technical terms are carefully defined in the text and also in a glossary. Those appearing in the glossary are printed in boldface when first introduced in the text. Special Features of the Fourth Edition </p><p> This fourth edition of Color reflects the tremendous range of color choices in the studio and the marketplace. There are now millions of colors available through computer graphics, more than the human eye can even distinguish. The section on computer-generated colors includes the complications of color matching when designers are working with both computer and printing technologies. Color choices in such crafts fields as ceramics, glass, and fibers are also mushrooming as they cross the soft boundary between fine and applied arts. Optical color effects continue to be an area of artistic experimentation, and these are illustrated and discussed in detail. </p><p> In the midst of these burgeoning choices, students are given a clear and solid foundation for understanding uses of color. Some 35 lively new images have been added to this edition, from cave paintings to twenty-first century virtual reality installations. Illustrations of points under discussion reflect the great variety in color applications, including historic and contemporary paintings, sculpture, installation pieces, crafts, photographs, advertisements, cartoons, commercial design, computer art, video, architecture, landscape design, interior design, and clothing. The work of women and multicultural art are naturally interwoven throughout the text. </p><p> For this edition, new visual demonstrations have been added, such as the effects of different lighting sources, reflective qualities of different surfaces, the Bezold Effect, and the phenomenon of color constancy. There is new material on the emotional and physiological effects of different hues, and on the spatial effects of colors. Cutting-edge virtual reality and video installations are illustrated and discussed. Website design and current printing technologies are included in updated discussions of computer-based art. Technical sections have been modified for greater clarity and ease of understanding. Technical material is provided in ways that can form take-off points for artists' own explorations of the intriguing world of color. </p><p> A special characteristic of this book is its extensive use of artists' own words about their use of color. More such quotations have been incorporated into this edition, and a new feature has been added: artists' quotations introducing each chapter. </p><p> Another special new feature of this edition is an appendix of Studio Color Problems. These comprise a great treasury of practical experiments with color based on the experiential teaching methods of the great colorist Josef Albers. Those using his experiential method might like to assign the first two chapters of the text to develop a general orientation and a basic vocabulary before launching into studio work, and then continue with the more theoretical and practical material introduced later in the book once students have made some discoveries on their own. Professor Zelanski is a former student of Albers and has found this method highly successful in four decades of teaching.

While his instinct for capturing what he called the decisive moment was unparalleled, as a photojournalist Cartier-Bresson was uniquely concerned with the human impact of historic events. In his photographs of the liberation of France from the Nazis, the death of Ghandi, and the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Cartier-Bresson focused on the reactions of the crowds rather than the subjects of the events. And while his portraits of Sartre, Giacometti, Faulkner, Capote, and other artists are iconic, he gave equal attention to those forgotten by history: a dead resistance fighter lying on the bank of the Rhine, children playing alongside the Berlin Wall, and a eunuch in Peking's Imperial Court. Divided into six thematic sections, the book presents the photographs in spare double-page spreads. In a handwritten note included at the end of the book, Cartier-Bresson writes, "In order to give meaning to the world, one must feel involved in what one singles out through the viewfinder." His work shows how he has been able to capture the decisive moment with such extreme humility and profound humanity.</p><p>YVES BONNEFOY was an art historian and is considered one of the most important French poets of the late twentieth century.</p><h2>Mathematics Elsewhere: An Exploration of Ideas Across Cultures</h2><p><p><i>Mathematics Elsewhere</i> is a fascinating and important contribution to a global view of mathematics. Presenting mathematical ideas of peoples from a variety of small-scale and traditional cultures, it humanizes our view of mathematics and expands our conception of what is mathematical.</p><br><p>Through engaging examples of how particular societies structure time, reach decisions about the future, make models and maps, systematize relationships, and create intriguing figures, Marcia Ascher demonstrates that traditional cultures have mathematical ideas that are far more substantial and sophisticated than is generally acknowledged. Malagasy divination rituals, for example, rely on complex algebraic algorithms. And some cultures use calendars far more abstract and elegant than our own. Ascher also shows that certain concepts assumed to be universal--that time is a single progression, for instance, or that equality is a static relationship--are not. The Basque notion of equivalence, for example, is a dynamic and temporal one not adequately captured by the familiar equal sign. Other ideas taken to be the exclusive province of professionally trained Western mathematicians are, in fact, shared by people in many societies.</p><br><p>The ideas discussed come from geographically varied cultures, including the Borana and Malagasy of Africa, the Tongans and Marshall Islanders of Oceania, the Tamil of South India, the Basques of Western Europe, and the Balinese and Kodi of Indonesia.</p><br><p>This book belongs on the shelves of mathematicians, math students, and math educators, and in the hands of anyone interested in traditional societies or how people think. Illustrating how mathematical ideas play a vital role in diverse human endeavors from navigation to social interaction to religion, it offers--through the vehicle of mathematics--unique cultural encounters to any reader.</p></p><p><p>"Ascher's <i>Ethnomathematics</i> was excellent--a real landmark--and this book is at least as good. It makes us realize that our way of looking at mathematics can be completely different from those in other cultures. A wonderful book."<b>--Peter Cameron, University of London</b></p><p>"This is a significant contribution to the recognized but still-emerging field of ethnomathematics. Its publication expands the available examples of mathematical ideas in traditional societies. In addition to being of interest to readers who look to the connection between culture and the development of ideas, this book should be of interest to educators at all levels who want to introduce students to diverse mathematical ideas."<b>--Rick Scott, New Mexico State University</b></p><p>"Learning how others interpret time and space is extremely vital for citizenship in a globalized society.

Written by three Latinas who have pastored and who teach in Latina/o communities, the book seeks to expand beyond Latina feminist and mujerista voices to include those whose perspectives have not yet been heard. It thus introduces an important theological perspective to a wider audience, and provides an important resource that has been lacking for evangelicas/os and other marginalized groups who study in various theological programs. Key terminology, such as evang�lica, is defined throughout, and a glossary is included for non-Spanish-speaking readers. Each chapter considers theological themes important to the Latina Protestant worshiping community, beginning with a constructive discussion of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit and followed by the doctrines of salvation and Jesus Christ, the Trinity, the church, Scripture, and &#34;the last things&#34; (eschatology). Given that one of the characteristics of Latina/o theologies is their dialogical and collaborative nature, the book concludes with a conversation among the three authors about the theological thinking that took place in its composition. Study questions are included at the end of each chapter.</p><p>Loida I.

In <em>Spain: A History</em>, he and eight other leading scholars--including Sebastian Balfour and Felipe Fernandez-Armesto--provide an authoritative overview of a country that has played a vital role in the history of the Western world.<br> Here is an up-to-date and engaging tour of Spain through the ages. We read of prehistoric Spain and of the imposition of Roman rule, which created the idea of Hispania as a single entity. There are knowledgeable discussions of the Visigoth monarchy, Moorish Spain, the establishment of an empire, and the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, all of which not only chart the political and economic development of Spain, but also examine the extraordinary artistic and literary achievements of the Spanish people. We read of the rise of liberalism in the nineteenth century, and of its fall, which ushered in a period of political instability culminating in the Civil War and authoritarian rule. The book concludes with a look at modern Spain as a fully integrated and enthusiastic member of the European community. <br> Attractively illustrated with eight pages of color plates and twenty-four black-and-white plates, <em>Spain: A History</em> is the best historical account of Spain currently available for general readers.</p><p>Spain, influential historians once maintained, was an "exceptional" country--meaning that, in many key respects, it lay outside the course of European history. Unlike any other nation of Western Europe, Spain was for centuries the province of Islamic rulers, and the crowned heads of other parts of the continent scorned it as an "oriental," necessarily backward nation--when in many ways it was considerably more advanced than its neighbors.<p> The exceptionalist view of Spanish history was misguided and damaging, writes the eminent historian Raymond Carr, but it was one that many Spanish people accepted: to them, it helped explain why Spain, once so mighty and rich an empire, should have fallen behind while the rest of Europe grew stronger and wealthier, and why a retrograde ruler like Franco could have remained in power when democracy flourished elsewhere.</p><p> Carr and his colleagues, including several Spanish scholars, seek to restore Spain to the mainstream of European history in this highly useful survey. Taking in a view that extends deep into prehistory and forward to the recent presidential elections, the contributors emphasize the diversity of Spain's many peoples, whose union under the kings and queens of Castile and Aragon would bring so much of the world under Spanish dominion, and the difficulty of maintaining that political union in the recent climate of ethnic and regional rivalry. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>Sir Raymond Carr</strong> is the former Warden of St. Antony's College, at Oxford University.

Butler's new interpretation does nothing less than reconceptualize the incest taboo in relation to kinship&#x2015;and open up the concept of kinship to cultural change.<br><br>Antigone, the renowned insurgent from Sophocles's <i>Oedipus,</i> has long been a feminist icon of defiance. But what has remained unclear is whether she escapes from the forms of power that she opposes. Antigone proves to be a more ambivalent figure for feminism than has been acknowledged, since the form of defiance she exemplifies also leads to her death. Butler argues that Antigone represents a form of feminist and sexual agency that is fraught with risk. Moreover, Antigone shows how the constraints of normative kinship unfairly decide what will and will not be a livable life.<br><br>Butler explores the meaning of Antigone, wondering what forms of kinship might have allowed her to live. Along the way, she considers the works of such philosophers as Hegel, Lacan, and Irigaray. How, she asks, would psychoanalysis have been different if it had taken Antigone&#x2015;the "postoedipal" subject&#x2015;rather than Oedipus as its point of departure? If the incest taboo is reconceived so that it does not mandate heterosexuality as its solution, what forms of sexual alliance and new kinship might be acknowledged as a result? The book relates the courageous deeds of Antigone to the claims made by those whose relations are still not honored as those of proper kinship, showing how a culture of normative heterosexuality obstructs our capacity to see what sexual freedom and political agency could be.</p><p>The celebrated author of <i>Gender Trouble</i> here redefines Antigone's legacy, recovering her revolutionary significance and liberating it for a progressive feminism and sexual politics.

The rich pedagogy of the Project Approach is emphasised by the wonderful images of children deeply engaged in their enquiry and research. As well as being Informative and inspirational, the book offers the practical steps needed to facilitate project based learning. It is abundantly clear - when children ask the questions - they are much more interesting in finding their own answers and solutions. A book that should be in every school. --Pete Moorhouse, Artist educator, Author, Early Years consultant and researcher. Bristol, UK<br><br>Best practice in today s classrooms means extending the joyous freedom of learning through observation, engagement, meaningful instruction and reflection. Sylvia Chard, Yvonne Kogan and Carmen Castillo in Picturing the Project Approach, Creative Explorations in Early Learning, exemplify, in a lucid way, how this type of learning can be accomplished. This book, with rich descriptions, detailed tables and vivid illustrations, provides step-by-step guidelines for using the Project Approach in any early childhood setting. The Project Approach is cogently presented as a framework for the in-depth investigation of real world topics relevant to children, their context, and their way of life. The narrative exemplifies how when children create their preferred language for interpretation and expression, their learning outcomes are greater. The authors welcome the readers into real classrooms with real students and a strong sense of purpose. Classrooms that nurture the intellect as well as the social and emotional development of every child. Of foremost value is the section of templates and sample letters included at the back of the book.

Paul Getty Museum)</h2><p>Included in the magnificent pages of the <em>Mira calligraphiae monumenta</em> are two alphabets. Executed by an unknown hand, the first consists of Roman capital letters; the other is Gothic lower-case letters. As with the calligraphy of Bocskay described above, these alphabets were embellished by Joris Hoefnagel, a painter at the court of Rudolf II. In embellishing the alphabets, Hoefnagel employed symbols and heraldic objects--masks, animals, plants, obelisks--to convey the power and greatness of the emperor.<br><br> <em>An Abecedarium</em> contains the thirty-eight pages from the <em>Mira</em> codex that display Hoefnagel's virtuosity in decorating the alphabets. Calligraphers, graphic artists, and all lovers of beautiful books will delight in Hoefnagel's artistry.</p><p>Taken from a 16th-century manuscript now housed in the Getty Museum, the intricate illustrations in this tiny volume are characteristic of Renaissance art: each letter is surrounded by religious and political imagery, as well as fanciful creatures and a fragment of a Psalm beginning with the respective letter. The warm, rich colors and the juxtaposition of elements such as crabs, asps, grapes, disembodied wings, crests, irises, and flags imbue each plate with a sense of divine haughtiness and humor. Besides the drawings themselves, the accompanying notes describe the evolution of different fonts, providing information that helps the reader interpret the wealth of information in each drawing.Demeude's preoccupation with letters has led him to bring together illuminated initials and ornamental characters from 12 centuries of alphabets and typography, ranging from 8th-century sacred manuscripts to 20th-century mass-produced postcards. Included are samples from over 100 alphabets created by such artists as Durer, Holbein, Daumier, and Kate Greenaway. The animated letters may be draped with the human form, used to offer historical or biblical scenes, or entwined with naturalistic scenes. While the accompanying historical notes and essays are succinct, the visuals will be of the most value as a study collection. The Getty's diminutive (51/4" x 71/4") volumes contain reproductions and notes on calligraphy and miniature paintings from a work commissioned by the court of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II during the 16th century. Currently in the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Mira calligraphiae monumenta (Model Book of Calligraphy) is the combined effort of master calligrapher Georg Bocskay and court artist Joris Hoefnagel. Considered one of the most precious books of the European Renaissance, it represents the transition from medieval European manuscript illumination to the emergence of the floral still life genre of the early 17th century. Nature Illuminated contains reproductions of 41 manuscript pages with meticulous studies of flora and fauna. An Abecedarium contains 38 illuminated reproductions of Roman capital and Gothic lowercase letters. These unique titles are best suited to specialized art and design collections.?Judith Yankeilun Lind, Roseland Free <br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Constitutional Law and Politics: Struggles for Power and Governmental Accountability (Volume 1)</h2><p><p><strong>A topical and comprehensive look at the Supreme Court cases that have shaped our nation.</strong></p> David O'Brien makes a daunting course more manageable by selecting and organizing the most important cases in U.S. history.

These two volumes include materials ranging from music fundamentals through twentieth-century music. The contents cover the needs of the usual two-year college music theory program in the subjects of harmony, melody, and form, with applications to analysis, writing (through both exercises employing figured bass and projects in original composition), and keyboard harmony. In addition, they correlate with the author's texts for sight singing and ear training, the other important aspects of the theory program, as discussed at the end of this preface. </p><p> Although the studies of harmonic concepts and structures are presented in a traditional and expected sequence, the order of chapters is not inflexible. Some studies can easily be presented at other points in the curriculum, as desired. Chapter 4, "Binary and Ternary Forms," can be introduced almost anywhere. The opening sections of Chapter 5, "Application of Part-Writing Procedures to Instrumental Music," may be used as correlating material as early as Chapter 1, with the rest of the chapter applicable to most of the remaining chapters of the text. Chapter 6, "Diatonic Seventh Chords," which seemingly appears late in the text, can easily follow Chapter 2. </p><p> Theory texts tend to present traditional materials in categories, their uses shown as abstract examples or from simple and uncomplicated excerpts from the works of composers. But there are many passages in music where a number of factors operate simultaneously, requiring the ability to isolate those factors and to study their interrelationships. Chapter 11, "Chords and Progressions in Special Situations," provides instruction in this type of analysis through the use of a number of interesting and challenging examples, from the works of Bach through those of late-nineteenth-century composers. </p><p> A survey of twentieth-century music covering three chapters concludes the text. A complete volume or several volumes are necessary for a thorough understanding of the subject, but this overview will be found effective in furnishing a solid foundation for later studies. These studies show how music late in the previous century literally used up its resources while at the same time it prophesied the music of the future. A chapter on the music of Debussy shows that he influenced the radical changes occurring at the turn of that century (1800&#x2014;1900) by using styles of writing markedly different from those of previous years. For twentieth-century music, included first are studies of music that show evolutionary development from the previous century. These are followed by studies of the development of new and original concepts in music composition. </p><p> Revision of the text material has been the principal concern of this fifth edition. Most chapters show numerous improvements, but those concerning diminished seventh harmony and the binary and ternary forms have been copiously rewritten. In addition, all chapters with part-writing exercises include additional exercises with only the bass line given. New examples from music literature include excerpts from works of women composers. </p><p> A <i>Workbook</i> is available as a companion to this text. Though its use is not required, many students will find it helpful, not only for the additional exercises and music excerpts, but especially for those exercises in a semiprogrammed format, by which a student can immediately compare the completed answer with the correct answer. Such exercises are identified in the present text with this statement: <i>In the Workbook: Answers are given.</i> </p><p> The remaining requirements of the theory program are covered by the author's other titles, <i>Music for Sight Singing</i>, fourth edition, 1996, and <i>Basic Ear Training Skills</i> (with Paul Dworak), 1991, a comprehensive text serving both as a workbook for the student and as a source of dictation materials for the teacher, together with five supplementary computer disks for independent student practice. Both volumes are published by Prentice Hall. </p><p> I would like to acknowledge the invaluable assistance of Professor Alan Swartz of the University of Texas at Tyler in preparing the fifth edition of <i>Advanced Harmony</i> for publication. </p><p> <i>Robert W.

Haught argues that the ongoing debate between Darwinian evolutionists and Christian apologists is fundamentally misdirected: Both sides persist in focusing on an explanation of underlying design and order in the universe. Haught suggests that what is lacking in both of these competing ideologies is the notion of novelty, a necessary component of evolution and the essence of the unfolding of the divine mystery. He argues that Darwin's disturbing picture of life, instead of being hostile to religion-as scientific skeptics and many believers have thought it to be-actually provides a most fertile setting for mature reflection on the idea of God. Solidly grounded in scholarship, Haught's explanation of the relationship between theology and evolution is both accessible and engaging. The second edition of <em>God After Darwin</em> features an entirely new chapter on the ongoing, controversial debate between intelligent design and evolution, including an assessment of Haught's experience as an expert witness in the landmark case of Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District on teaching evolution and intelligent design in schools.</p><p>John F Haught&#34;Highly provocative and much more comprehensible and enjoyable reading than anything produced by either Teilhard de Chardin or Whitehead...Highly recommended for philosophers, biologists, theologians, college students, and general readers interested in the interface between metaphysics, science and theology.&#34; Choice; &#34;As an evolutionary biologist I cannot fail to be excited about Haught&#39;s writing.&#34; Church Times</p><h2>Travels with Charley: In Search of America</h2><p>To hear the speech of the real America, to smell the grass and the trees, to see the colors and the light&#x2014; these were John Steinbeck's goals as he set out, at the age of fifty-eight, to rediscover the country he had been writing about for so many years.</p><p>In September 1960, John Steinbeck and his poodle, Charley, embarked on a journey across America. A picaresque tale, this chronicle of their trip meanders along scenic backroads and speeds along anonymous superhighways, moving from small towns to growing cities to glorious wilderness oases. Travels with Charley is animated by Steinbeck&#39;s attention to the specific details of the natural world and his sense of how the lives of people are intimately connected to the rhythms of nature - to weather, geography, the cycles of the seasons. His keen ear for the transactions among people is evident, too, as he records the interests and obsessions that preoccupy the Americans he encounters along the way.<b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel, <b>Cup of Gold</b> (1929).<p>After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books, <b>The Pastures of Heaven</b> (1932) and <b>To a God Unknown</b> (1933), and worked on short stories later collected in <b>The Long Valley</b> (1938). Popular success and financial security came only with <b>Tortilla Flat </b>(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class: <b>In Dubious Battle</b> (1936), <b>Of Mice and Men</b> (1937), and the book considered by many his finest, <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1939). <b>The Grapes of Wrath</b> won both the <b>National Book Award</b> and the <b>Pulitzer Prize</b> in 1939.</p><p>Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with <b>The Forgotten Village</b> (1941) and a serious student of marine biology with <b>Sea of Cortez</b> (1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette <b>The Moon is Down</b> (1942). <b>Cannery Row</b> (1945), <b>The Wayward Bus</b> (1948), another experimental drama, <b>Burning Bright</b> (1950), and <b>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</b> (1951) preceded publication of the monumental <b>East of Eden</b> (1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.</p><p>The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include <b>Sweet Thursday</b> (1954), <b>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</b> (1957), <b>Once There Was a War </b>(1958), <b>The Winter of Our Discontent </b>(1961), <b>Travels with Charley in Search of America </b>(1962), <b>America and Americans</b> (1966), and the posthumously published <b>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</b> (1969), <b>Viva Zapata!</b> (1975), <b>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</b> (1976), and <b>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</b> (1989).</p><p>Steinbeck received the <b>Nobel Prize in Literature</b> in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the <b>United States Medal of Freedom</b> by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.</p></p><h2>Inner Vision: An Exploration of Art and the Brain</h2><p>What is it that makes a work of art appear to us as beautiful? How do external form and internal perception coalesce to create the distinctive aesthetic pleasures we look to find in the visual arts? In <em>Inner Vision</em>, one of the founders of visual neuroscience, Semir Zeki, offers the first attempt to apply the science of vision to painting and sculpture, revealing how the conception, execution, and appreciation of the visual arts are all shaped by the anatomy of the brain. <br> Using a range of examples from artists including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Magritte, Mondrian, and Picasso, Zeki takes the reader on an illuminating tour of the way the brain sees, showing how its visual processing shapes art and our response to it. Vision, he writes, is designed to gather knowledge about the world around us, breaking down visual images into their basic components. He describes in fascinating detail how different areas of the brain respond to the basic visual elements, such as color, form, line, and motion, which are also basic elements of art. He further argues that all visual art is expressed through the brain and, whether the artist realizes it or not, must therefore mirror the workings of the brain. Beauty may not be in the eye of the beholder, strictly speaking, but it most certainly <em>is</em> in the brain of the beholder. And Zeki argues that no theory of aesthetics will be complete unless it is substantially based on the activity of the brain. <br> Beautifully illustrated and vividly written, <em>Inner Vision</em> takes an important first step toward providing a scientific theory of aesthetics.</p><p>Why do we find it hard to explain why art is beautiful? Perhaps it is because the visual system of the human brain is much more developed than its language centers, as it has had far longer--millions of years--to evolve. Semir Zeki believes that we can only reach a better understanding of art as we learn more about the operations of the visual brain. <p> Zeki demonstrates that the simple act of seeing is a profoundly artistic activity. Separating out the mass of geometrical and spectral information received through the eye to arrive at a visual perception is a complex and creative process. Zeki traces the functional similarities of the artist and the seeing brain. "Just as the brain searches for constancies and essentials," Zeki writes, "so does art.... It is those attributes of vision [to which] the brain has assigned specialised processing systems ... that have primacy in art. Among those one can include colour, form, motion, faces, facial expressions and even body language."</p><p> Zeki's examples are varied and convincing. For example, he explores the relationship between modern works that have emphasized lines and the reaction of cells in the brain that work on lines of specific orientation. More ambitiously, he even outlines the neurological bases of Fauvism and Cubism! </p><p> T.S. Eliot said that using language to discuss art was "a raid on the inarticulate, with shabby equipment." In <i>Inner Vision</i>, that pejorative statement acquires a heroic mantle: no artist worth the name and no one who enjoys visual beauty can afford to ignore the insights contained in this book. <i>--Simon Ings, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br><strong>Semir Zeki</strong> is a research scientist at the Wellcome Cognitive Neurology Unit of the University College, London.

With her incisive verve and moxie, eminent feminist Cynthia Enloe shows that the people who become militarized are not just the obvious ones&#x2015;executives and factory floor workers who make fighter planes, land mines, and intercontinental missiles. They are also the employees of food companies, toy companies, clothing companies, film studios, stock brokerages, and advertising agencies. Militarization is never gender-neutral, Enloe claims: It is a personal and political transformation that relies on ideas about femininity and masculinity. Films that equate action with war, condoms that are designed with a camouflage pattern, fashions that celebrate brass buttons and epaulettes, tomato soup that contains pasta shaped like Star Wars weapons&#x2015;all of these contribute to militaristic values that mold our culture in both war and peace.<br><br>Presenting new and groundbreaking material that builds on Enloe's acclaimed work in <i>Does Khaki Become You?</i> and <i>Bananas, Beaches, and Bases, Maneuvers</i> takes an international look at the politics of masculinity, nationalism, and globalization. Enloe ranges widely from Japan to Korea, Serbia, Kosovo, Rwanda, Britain, Israel, the United States, and many points in between. She covers a broad variety of subjects: gays in the military, the history of "camp followers," the politics of women who have sexually serviced male soldiers, married life in the military, military nurses, and the recruitment of women into the military. One chapter titled "When Soldiers Rape" explores the many facets of the issue in countries such as Chile, the Philippines, Okinawa, Rwanda, and the United States.<br><br>Enloe outlines the dilemmas feminists around the globe face in trying to craft theories and strategies that support militarized women, locally and internationally, without unwittingly being militarized themselves. She explores the complicated militarized experiences of women as prostitutes, as rape victims, as mothers, as wives, as nurses, and as feminist activists, and she uncovers the "maneuvers" that military officials and their civilian supporters have made in order to ensure that each of these groups of women feel special and separate.</p><p>"Enloe blends a sharp analytical eye with an attention to real people's lives. She examines the structural forces that militarize our lives, but does not overlook the role of the individual in either advancing or resisting militarization."&#x2015;Jennifer Turpin, coeditor of <i>The Women and War Reader</i><br><br>"One of the most impressive things about this book is its breadth, and the way in which Enloe runs her thread through so many different issues, so many different women's stories and experiences."&#x2015;Sandra Whitworth, author of <i>Feminism and International Relations</i><br><br>"Cynthia Enloe here rethinks the global militarization of women's lives that she first confronted in her now-classic <i>Does Khaki Become You?</i> With her customary insight, sensitivity, and eloquence, Enloe helps us to see the connections among diverse groups of women in every corner of the world. If her unravelling of the process of militarization can make frightening reading, at the same time she holds out hope by showing that demilitarization, like its opposite, comes about through concrete acts and decisions."&#x2015;Leila J.

Collins]<br><br> By the author of <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, a horrifying journey into a future only Ira Levin could imagine.<br><br> Considered one of the great dystopian novels - alongside Anthony Burgess' <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> and Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i> - Ira Levin's frightening glimpse into the future continues to fascinate readers even forty years after publication. - - The story is set in a seemingly perfect global society. Uniformity is the defining feature; there is only one language and all ethnic groups have been eugenically merged into one race called ''The Family.'' The world is ruled by a central computer called UniComp that has been programmed to keep every single human on the surface of the earth in check. People are continually drugged by means of regular injections so that they can never realize their potential as human beings, but will remain satisfied and cooperative. They are told where to live, when to eat, whom to marry, and when to reproduce. Even the basic facts of nature are subject to the UniComp's will - men do not grow facial hair, women do not develop breasts, and it only rains at night. - - With a vision as frightening as any in the history of the science fiction genre, <i>This Perfect Day</i> is one of Ira Levin's most haunting novels.</p><p><b>Ira Levin</b> (1929-2007) was the highly acclaimed and internationally bestselling author of <em>The Boys from Brazil</em>, <em>Rosemary's Baby, Son of Rosemary, The Stepford Wives</em>, <em>This Perfect Day</em>, <em>Sliver</em>, and <em>A Kiss Before Dying</em> (for which he won the Edgar Award).

He emigrated to Canada in 1948, where he became a journalist and adopted Canadian citizenship. He wrote his first three novels while living in Canada. His many honours include two Governor General&#39;s Awards for Fiction.Laforgue felt his body tremble. What can be keeping them? Has the Commandant refused? Why has he not sent for me? Is this God&#x2019;s punishment for my lie about my hearing? But it wasn&#x2019;t a lie; my intention was honorable. Or is that a sophistry? Am I now so mired in my ambition that I can no longer tell truth from falsehood? For what seemed the hundredth time, the sentry on duty outside the Commandant&#x2019;s quarters turned and marched along the ramparts of the fort. Laforgue heard voices. He looked down the steep path which led to the wooden buildings of the settlement. Two men were coming up. One was an officer, his slouch hat tilted over his forehead, his uniform whitened by dust. When Laforgue saw the face of the second man, he felt a sudden disquiet. A month ago, this man, a fur trader named Mass�, had run from the stinking wineshop where the traders drank to yell obscene insults at Laforgue. The insults concerned a Savage girl Mass� had been sleeping with, a girl Laforgue had lately tried to instruct in the faith.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, seeking to avoid further taunts, he moved closer to the shadow of the ramparts. And as he did, he looked up at the Commandant&#x2019;s quarters. Framed in a window was the face of Champlain.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Commandant, sitting at his window, saw a wide- brimmed clerical hat tilt up to reveal the pale, bearded visage of Father Laforgue. He looked past the lonely figure of the priest to the settlement of Qu�bec, a jumble of wooden buildings, three hundred feet below. As in a painting, his eye was led toward the curve of the great river where four French ships lay at anchor. In a week they would be gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Behind him, he heard the Jesuit Superior cough, a small reminder, deferential yet impatient. &#x201c;You were saying, Commandant?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I said it is late in the year. Tell them that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Jesuit, Father Bourque, translated for the Savages. Chomina, the elder Savage, had shaved his head bald except for a ridge of hair, which bristled across the crown like the spine of a hedgehog. His face was a mask of white clay. The younger, a leader called Neehatin, had ornamented himself for this occasion by drawing rings of yellow ochre around his eyes and painting his nose a bright blue. Both watched Champlain as they might a large and unpredictable animal.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the Jesuit had finished, the younger Savage spoke. Champlain turned to him as a deaf man toward moving lips. In all these years, he, the founder of this land, had not mastered the Savage tongue.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He asks if Agnonha no longer wishes them to carry the French,&#x201d; Father Bourque said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Why would he ask that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I think they are worried that you will not give them the six muskets they have requested,&#x201d; the Jesuit said. &#x201c;As you know, your Excellency, this is the real reason they have offered to help us.&#x201d; Champlain smiled at the Savage. &#x201c;Tell him Agnonha is grateful for his offer of help. Tell him that for once Agnonha may be willing to offer muskets as presents. But tell him my concern is this. To succeed, the journey should have started three weeks ago.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;With respect,&#x201d; Father Bourque said, &#x201c;I think there is still time to reach the Ihonatiria mission. As you know, I have twice made this journey myself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Champlain looked at the priest&#x2019;s black cassock and thought, irreverently, that it reminded him of a schoolboy&#x2019;s smock. When you were still a boy in school, Father, I made and mapped the journey of which you speak. What do you know of that time? Why do you think these Savages want muskets? It is not to hunt but to kill their enemies.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It is not just the onset of winter,&#x201d; he told the Jesuit. &#x201c;There is the other, the greater danger. We have not spoken of that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The Jesuit bowed his head. &#x201c;The journey, like our lives, is in God&#x2019;s hands.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But what if there is no mission? What if Laforgue arrives to find the two Fathers dead?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We will cross that bridge when we come to it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Champlain fingered his graying beard in a gesture which semaphored his irritation. &#x201c;Not <i>we</i>,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It is Father Laforgue who must cross it. I do not know him well, but certainly he has no experience of these hardships.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Would you wish to question him, your Excellency? I have brought him with me. He waits outside.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What can I learn from that? I have said he has no experience of the great river.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In my opinion,&#x201d; the Jesuit said, &#x201c;he is adequate to the task. He is an ordained member of the Society of Jesus and, as such, his capabilities have been carefully assessed by the Order.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;You are talking of assessments which were made in France. I am talking of dangers and sufferings the Society of Jesus has not dreamed of.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;With respect,&#x201d; Father Bourque said. &#x201c;There are few hardships not envisaged or experienced by our members in different lands.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Champlain looked at the Savages, who squatted on the floor, their knees as high as their heads. The Savages considered it ill- mannered to parley while standing. While he had been careful to remain seated, the Jesuit carelessly paced the room. &#x201c;The young man you are sending with him is a boy, not yet twenty,&#x201d; Champlain said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;True. But he is an exceptional young man.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In what way is he exceptional, Father?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He was sent out as a workman, but with the highest recommendations. He is devout and diligent. His uncle, a priest, instructed him in Latin, and he studied with the R�collet Fathers in Rouen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Latin will not help him on the great river.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No. But he is highly intelligent and adaptable. When I discovered his talent for languages, I sent him off to spend time with the Algonkin at their eel fishery. In a year he has mastered Algonkian and Huron speech.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Champlain heard a sudden noise. It was the noise of a wooden bowl striking against the floor. The Savages had begun to gamble, shaking the bowl and examining the plum stones in it. The stones were painted white on one side, black on the other. The gamble was to guess which color predominated.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Father,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We have talked too long in our tongue. They are weary of us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;True. My apologies.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Again, the bowl banged on the floor. Champlain felt a familiar numbness move up his arm. Will this be my last winter? Will I never again see the red flame of Richelieu&#x2019;s robe come toward me in the long gallery of the Palais de Justice, passing all those who seek his ear? I bend to kiss his ring; he smiles at me, a smile that tells nothing of the smiler&#x2019;s thought. Who will he send here to replace me? And what would he say to this request? The journey to almost certain death of a priest and a boy, against the chance to save a small outpost for France and for the Faith. In the conquest of a nation, lives are currency.<br>&nbsp;<br>He had his answer. He smiled at the painted faces.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Tell them six muskets. No more.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Laforgue, watching, at last saw the Superior and the Savages emerge from the Commandant&#x2019;s quarters.<br>&nbsp;<br>Is it yes or no? Why did he not send for me? Quickly, he walked along beneath the ramparts, controlling his desire to break into a run. The Superior, passing the guard, turned to the Savages, but the Savages, whose custom it was not to utter formal farewells, simply walked away. They did not use the path which led down to the settlement, but went across the rougher terrain which led to their encampment.<br>&nbsp;<br>Father Bourque looked back when he heard Laforgue&#x2019;s footstep. &#x201c;Ah, there you are,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Come. We must hurry.&#x201d; He moved past Laforgue, going down the path. Laforgue, trained in the rule of obedience, did not ask the question which consumed his thoughts, but fell in a pace behind him.<br>&nbsp;<br>They passed by the officer and Mass�, who, coming up, bowed respectfully to the Superior. Mass� did not look at Laforgue. In silence, the two priests continued down to the jetty, where their canoe was moored. Father Bourque waited while Laforgue untied the rope and, draping his wooden clogs around his neck so as not to damage the thin bark bottom, stepped neatly into the birch- bark craft, and held it steady against the mooring place. Father Bourque, also removing his clogs, got into the front of the canoe as Laforgue, kneeling precisely as the Savages had taught him, carefully moved the craft out onto the river.<br>&nbsp;<br>He heeled it toward a tributary which led downstream to the Jesuit residence. Father Bourque took up his paddle. Steadily they stroked toward the far bank of the tributary, where a rectangle of wooden palisades enclosed two buildings which formed the residence. Laforgue, aware that the Superior was judging his skills, rose up at the precise moment the swift canoe glided to shore and leaped onto the landing place, neatly catching the prow and guiding it in.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Where is Daniel?&#x201d; Father Bourque asked, as he disembarked. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I believe they are all working up at the storehouse.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;All of them?&#x201d; The Superior did not wait for a reply but set off along the narrow track which led to the residence. As they entered the long- grassed meadows surrounding the palisades, a miasma of mosquitoes clouded about them, causing them to slap their faces, duck and proceed, half running, toward the gate.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Find Daniel and bring him to me,&#x201d; the Superior said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Inside the gate they separated, Father Bourque entering the principal building, a one- story construction of wooden planks, plastered with mud and thatched with grasses. Laforgue hurried on to the second building, half burned some years back by the English, a building the Jesuits&#x2019; workmen were now repairing. As he approached, he heard the sound of hammering and laughter; someone shouted something in the Breton tongue. Escaping the mosquito cloud, he ducked under the hanging which served for a door. As he did, the laughter and hammering ceased and from their perches and workbenches the men looked down at him in silence.<br>&nbsp;<br>The head carpenter had asked the question, but Laforgue looked at Daniel Davost, who stood, holding a plank, his mouth full of nails.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No news yet,&#x201d; Laforgue said. &#x201c;But Father Bourque wants to see Daniel at once.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;re going,&#x201d; the carpenter said. The other workmen exchanged glances. All of them disapproved of the priests&#x2019; sending a young boy on this dangerous journey. And now, as Daniel left with Laforgue, angry voices were raised, speaking Breton, which Laforgue did not understand.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What did they say, Daniel?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nothing, Father. Some joke.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Outside, in the choking swarm of insects, they ran toward the main residence. As they entered they passed through the chapel, a small bare room with a wooden altar on which were two cloth hangings; one represented the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, the other an image of the Virgin. The chapel opened into the refectory, which the priests used also as their workroom. In this room twelve Savage men and women squatted on the ground in a semicircle, just inside the doorway.<br>&nbsp;<br>They did not move when Daniel and Laforgue entered but kept their eyes on a clock which sat on the refectory table. The smell of their unwashed bodies and greasy hair filled the room with a pungent sickly odor. Two other priests, Fathers Bonnet and Meynard, were in the adjoining kitchen together with a lay brother.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Private Gardens of Connecticut</h2><p>Connecticut is uniquely rich in beautiful landscape, encompassing more than six hundred miles of serene shoreline along Long Island Sound, untold acres of open farmland, and the rolling hills and lakes of the famed northwest corner on the New York/Massachusetts border.

I love being in my own, but I also get enormous pleasure from going to other people&#x2019;s, talking to them, smelling their roses, and listening to their plans. It&#x2019;s a pleasure I didn&#x2019;t know I was missing until I caught the gardening bug. That happened in the 1970s when my husband and I became the owners of a dilapidated eighteenth-century saltbox in northwest Connecticut. It came with a lot of untended grass and little else in the way of landscaping. Since my husband was preoccupied with the structure of the house, it&nbsp; seemed logical that the out-of-doors should be my responsibility.<br><br>Knowing almost nothing about even the most basic principles of horticulture, I was hardly a willing recruit. I am English and grew up in England and, to my astonishment, I found my American friends assumed, that the English are born with a grasp of the subtleties of successful composting, knew how to prune, and could, of course, tell the difference between a rugosa rose and a hybrid tea. My pleas of ignorance were interpreted as false modesty and there was general disbelief when I tried to explain that neither of my parents were the least bit interested in anything to do with gardens. The only formative experience in horticulture I can remember was going with one of my aunts&#x2014;a passionate rosarian&#x2014;on a trip to Whipsnade Zoo to collect buckets of elephant dung with which to cover her roses.<br><br>But back to my garden. It suffered not only from my lack of experience but also from the rigors of Connecticut&#x2019;s harsh winters and sweltering summers, and even the occasional hurricane.&nbsp; While my neighbors took these conditions in stride, my English friends were incredulous when I told them of dawn raids by hungry deer, surprise incursions by egg-laying snapping turtles, temperatures that dropped well below minus 10 in the winter, snow in April, and once even frost during the last week of May. But, somehow as I began to learn some of the complexities of gardening in a country with ten different hardiness zones, I got hooked and soon there was nothing I liked better than going to see gardens and learning from their owners how to work around the limitations of this unforgiving climate. So, when many years later the chance arose to do a book with my friend photographer John Hall about private gardens of Connecticut, I couldn&#x2019;t believe my good fortune.<br><br>Connecticut is the third smallest state in America (ninety-five miles by sixty-five miles at its widest point), but its topography is surprisingly varied, stretching from the shoreline of Long Island Sound to the Litchfield Hills and from the suburbs of New York to well north of Hartford. Home of patriot Nathan Hale, actress Katharine Hepburn, writer Mark Twain, and composer Charles Ives, Connecticut is known for its insurance industry and its state flower (mountain laurel) but not particularly for its gardens,&nbsp; in spite of a rich garden history. <br><br>Toward the end of the nineteenth century, Greenwich emerged as a fashionable suburb of New York, and Connecticut&#x2019;s coastline began to attract a succession of summer visitors, including New Yorkers with power and money such as William Rockefeller (John D.&#x2019;s brother), Lewis Lapham, one of the founders of Texaco Oil Company, and Edmund Converse, the inventor and founder of U.S. Steel. These industrialists created vast estates with palatial European-inspired gardens, or chose American landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted, Charles Gillette, Fletcher Steele, Warren Manning, Beatrix Farrand, and Ellen Biddle Shipman to design their gardens. The gardens of one estate in Greenwich were so vast that more than fifteen gardeners were required to maintain them. Morton Plant&#x2019;s Branford House near Groton boasted an astonishing sunken water garden with a circular fountain and mounded beds designed by landscape architect Guy Lowell. Eolia, the elegant summer mansion of the Harkness family, set on over 230 seaside acres of sweeping lawns at Goshen Point, a little south of New London, started out as an Italianate garden with colonnaded loggias but was later redesigned by Beatrix Farrand in the style of an English Edwardian garden. <br><br>Sadly, most of these gardens have not survived, and many of the grand ones were turned into tennis courts or swimming pools in the 1950s. One of Beatrix Farrand&#x2019;s gardens was replaced with sod in order to make an outdoor seating area, while that of Standard Oil heiress Annie Burr Jennings ended up as a residential subdivision. Others literally went to seed after years of neglect as the expense of maintaining their labor intensive outdoor rooms became too great. There are some exceptions, the two most notable being Eolia, now Harkness State Park, and Hill-Stead House in Farmington, both of which are open to the public today and give a sense of what that grand and lost tradition was all about.<br><br>For this book, we were not, however, searching so much for historical gardens as for twentieth-century work. Inevitably, we have seen more gardens than we could possibly include and inevitably there will be those who disagree with the choices we have made. But, here, another confession is in order. This book was never intended to be a comprehensive survey of private gardens in Connecticut, but is instead a personal and often idiosyncratic selection. Our criteria were simple. We wanted to include gardens from as many parts of the state as possible and to focus on the wide diversity of styles from formal to small, contemporary, wild, and old-fashioned. Some of those we selected had never been professionally photographed while others had been published, and in some cases frequently. Some are open to visitors a few times a year through the Garden Conservancy&#x2019;s popular Open Day Program; others do not participate. Some are grand in scale, others exceedingly modest but all have been cared for and tended with great love. None of these gardens was made overnight and many have taken years to come to fruition. The garden of the Greek god Adonis may have &#x201c;one day blossomed and fruitful were the next&#x201d; but not any of the gardens featured in this book. <br><br>As I crisscrossed the state searching out gardens, I was struck again and again by how essentially rural Connecticut still is. Even Hartford, its capital and second largest city with a population of 124,512, is tiny by today&#x2019;s standards. In spite of its small size, Connecticut&#x2019;s climate is tremendously variable, incorporating three different plant hardiness zones. Its landscape too is surprisingly varied, encompassing 618 miles of magnificent coastline, untold acres of glorious open farmland, and steep wooded hills. The one connecting thread to be found in every part of the state is, however, stone.<br><br>Connecticut once had hundreds of quarries, although not many survive today. The stone from each was unique, a testament to the state&#x2019;s complex geology. Granite from Stony Creek in Eastern Connecticut became the base of the Statue of Liberty and was used in building New York&#x2019;s Grand Central Terminal, while rich chocolate-colored sandstone from Portland near Middletown was the most common building material of the nineteenth century and gave its name to many thousands of New York townhouses. Today, what we most notice are the miles and miles of long winding iconic stone walls that traverse the state and are such a poignant reminder of Connecticut farming. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries these dry-stone walls were stacked and laid without the aid of any concrete mortar. Made to fence in animals, divide farming pastures, and delineate property lines, they were strictly utilitarian. Today they are one of the most distinctive features of the Connecticut landscape, their lyrical lines testimony to their mostly anonymous builders. Every garden in this book makes use of local stone in one way or another, be it for walls, pathways, or extending rock ledges, and whether intentionally or by happenstance, stone is incorporated into their overall design.<br><br>Writing tends to be a solitary occupation so I feel extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to collaborate with a remarkably talented photographer. Seeing a garden through John&#x2019;s eyes, discussing what makes it unique, and deciding how and what to focus on has been an eye-opening experience. In writing about gardens, the seventeenth-century poet Andrew Marvell refers to their &#x201c;delicious solitude.&#x201d; That description holds true for all of the gardens in this book. They are personal and private in the best sense of the word, and to make each of them come alive to others, the camera must capture the garden&#x2019;s personality and the text reveal it. I hope that we have succeeded.</p><h2>The One, the Three and the Many: God, Creation and the Culture of Modernity / The 1992 Bampton Lectures</h2><p>This study, based on the Bampton Lectures delivered in the University of Oxford in 1992, examines what is often called the crisis of modernity, with reference not only to modernity but to modern culture in general. Problems of social, theological, and philosophical thought are traced back beyond the Enlightenment to the very roots of Western Christian theology. A response to these problems is essayed by constructively developing conceptual possibilities to be found in ancient and modern theology of the Trinity.</p><p>Based on the Bampton Lectures delivered in the University of Oxford in 1992, this study examines the crisis of modern culture.

In a state where the altitude varies from 3,000 feet above sea level at Carlsbad, to 13,000 feet at Mount Wheeler near Taos, where the annual rainfall is anywhere from 7 inches at White Sands to 30 inches in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, where the soil is loose and gravelly, or thick and hard, or dark and rich, this guide, organized by regions and specific cities, will be especially useful. It also includes information on adjacent areas in Colorado and Arizona and in El Paso. In addition to the top hundred-plus species for each location, the author provides suggestions for more adventurous gardeners and information on historic landscapes around the state. He also points out a favorite well-planned and well-maintained garden or landscape that is open to the public in each community.</p><p>A landscape architect in Albuquerque for twenty-five years, Baker Morrow is intimately acquainted with how things grow in New Mexico. He is also generous in sharing his personal preferences. He mentions the species he likes "for their toughness, adaptability, and sturdy beauty in a difficult climate," and also the ones he admires for "their cheerfulness and their ability to grace our lives with shade, with helpful protection from the wind, and an endless series of wonderful colors." With many hundreds of native and exotic species readily available, no New Mexico gardener can afford to be without this book.</p></p><p>A thorough, richly illustrated and practical guide to what grows best in every part of the state and adjacent areas.Baker H.

I also like to cook, so I can eat the food I enjoy the most&#x2014; healthy, energizing, and so delicious that there is no talk of compromise.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a vegetarian for twenty years. I wish I could say I had noble intentions around making the change, but really, I did it to impress a boy I liked! True story. It is funny how life works; that short-lived teenage crush was the origin of a transformative shift for me. Becoming vegetarian led to a lifelong love of mindfulness, yoga, and of course, nutrition. Back then, I thought mac and cheese was the height of sophistication and health. Vegetarian eating meant no meat, but that did not necessarily equate to eating many whole plant foods.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after I became vegetarian, I tried a brief and somewhat disastrous stint with totally plant-based eating that left me hungry because I did not really know how to craft a nutritious plant-based meal. But times have changed. I am now a plant-based eater, but I did not get here overnight. It was a slow transition that felt positive and joyful at every step. Moving toward a more plant-based, anti-inflammatory eating plan is probably one of the most transformative actions you can take for your health. It will help you feel more energized and resilient in your everyday life. It will also help you prevent chronic illness and support you in healing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes time to unlearn the hyper-processed eating pattern that is so common in our world. When you break rank with the status quo and dip your toe into plant-based living, it might feel foreign. It might even taste foreign (which is ironic, since by definition artificial sweeteners and colours are the foreign ingredients). However, when you explore it with a sense of play&#x2014;free of absolutes&#x2014;you will discover that this plant stuff is actually delicious. Of course, it is all in the approach. Go ahead and add a bit of extra salt or maple syrup to your meal if you need it to help you transition your taste buds. Have fun exploring plant-based versions of your favourite meals. Do not force yourself to eat foods you hate or attempt to cook tofu for the first time without a recipe, or you may think this healthy eating stuff isn&#x2019;t worth the price of admission.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By putting this book in your hands, you are on the right track. When you cook and eat these recipes, you may feel a bit peppier and want to feel that way again. It does not matter if you want nachos on a Friday night (and I have a queso recipe to help with that!). Just eat plants the rest of the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Just Eat More Plants</b><br><br>There are few absolutes in nutrition, but every single one of us can benefit from eating more plants. Regardless of how you choose to eat, this is the one rule we all need to live by. If you love bacon, have a little less and be sure to eat more plants. If you eat a vegan diet, watch the cookies and be sure to eat more plants. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the dietary tribes will not always admit this, what they have in common is plants. A truly Paleo plate? A little bit of animal protein and 75 percent plants. A whole food vegan diet? All plants. Even ketogenic diets, when done well, can include many low-carbohydrate plants.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life demands more from us than ever before. Stress, poor food choices, and inactivity are all too common, and they are saddling us with chronic inflammatory issues like metabolic syndrome, digestive trouble, and autoimmunity. Food is often a big part of our ills . . . and anti-inflammatory, plant-based eating is a big part of the solution. However, what that looks like for you is your decision. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to go fully plant-based, good on you. I am all for it! It is an incredible way to live, and I have a chapter that will help guide you through the transition. However, if you cannot imagine a life without a burger, do not think that a <i>plant-centred</i> life is not for you. The more we pile our plate with plants, the better it is for our bodies, our ecosystem, and our pocketbooks. Eat the recipes in this book as often as you can. Start slowly and see where it takes you.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever you are in your wellness journey, adopting a more plant-based, anti-inflammatory diet will help you get to where you are going. Stay open-minded and be gentle with yourself, as making change is never a straight line. There is no right or wrong here. Have fun in the kitchen and enjoy what you eat! I am honoured that you have chosen this book to help you eat more plants.<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Vibrant Living <br></b> <br>True wellness, particularly when your intention is to calm inflammation, is a way of living as much as it is a way of eating. The thoughts we think and the way we move our bodies have just as much of an impact as how we choose to eat. As you explore preparing more anti-inflammatory meals for yourself, consider how the following principles can help guide you in building a truly vibrant life. <br><br><b>LISTEN TO YOUR BODY <br></b>There is no one right way to eat; we all need to find the way of eating that helps us feel our best. You can do that by observing how the food you eat makes you feel: physically, emotionally, and psychologically. <br><br><b> GET PLANT POWERED <br></b> Plant-based foods are nature&#x2019;s nutrient-dense gift to you. Eating more plants is a way of nourishing your body, respecting the impact that your food choices have on others, and treading more lightly on the planet.<br><br><b>PRACTISE SELF-LOVE<br></b>Perfection is a myth; be gentle with your intentions to eat well and give yourself the flexibility to choose foods that nourish your soul as well as your body. There is no right or wrong. Work toward disconnecting your self-worth from your food choices. At the end of the day, it is just food. <br><br><b> EMBRACE AN ATTITUDE OF MORE, NOT LESS<br></b>Focusing on eating less, or choosing certain foods less often, leads to a sense of deprivation, loss, and anxiety. Instead, focus on what to do more often. Eat more plants. Drink more water. Cook more often. Make eating well a positive, joyful process. <br><br><b> CREATE SPACE FOR CHANGE <br></b> Making change takes effort. Create the space in your life to allow it to happen. Release commitments that are not important to you so you can shop and cook. Spend time moving your body. Carve out time for stillness and be mindful. Unplug from your screens daily and let your mind wander and be at rest. Make sleep a priority.<br><br><b>KEEP IT SIMPLE<br></b>Choose single-ingredient foods more often&#x2014;eat real food, not hyper-processed approximations of it. Instead of ordering takeout, get your hands dirty in the kitchen. Reconnect to where your food comes from and grow something on a windowsill or patio or in your backyard. Spend as much time outside as humanly possible and breathe deeply. <br><b><br>FIND YOUR INNER STRENGTH <br></b> Your body has the remarkable capacity to repair and rebuild. This ability is sewn into your DNA and is an integral component of life itself. Know that no matter where you are starting from, you can support your body in healing and find a new vitality. Nourishing yourself well will help you tap into your potential in other aspects of your life with a newfound energy</p><h2>Discrete-Time Control Systems</h2><p><p>The new edition of this comprehensive digital controls book integrates MATLAB throughout the book.

Individuals, city leaders, and kings came from all over the Mediterranean and beyond to consult Delphi's oracular priestess; to set up monuments to the gods; and to take part in competitions.</p><p>In this richly illustrated account, Michael Scott covers the history and nature of Delphi, from the literary and archaeological evidence surrounding the site, to its rise as a center of worship, to the constant appeal of the oracle despite her cryptic prophecies. He describes how Delphi became a contested sacred site for Greeks and Romans and a storehouse for the treasures of rival city-states and foreign kings. He also examines the eventual decline of the site and how its meaning and importance have continued to be reshaped.</p><p>A unique window into the center of the ancient world, <i>Delphi</i> will appeal to general readers, tourists, students, and specialists.</p></p><p><p>"Like the two eagles released by Zeus from opposite ends of the world who then met in Delphi, Michael Scott gets to the heart of antiquity's most celebrated and enigmatic oracle.

Scott's irresistible narrative brings it all back to life."<b>--Barry Strauss, author of <i>Masters of Command: Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar, and the Genius of Leadership</i></b></p><p>"Few scholars know the history of ancient Delphi as intimately as Michael Scott does. Apollo's injunction to 'know yourself' is as hard to obey now as it was in ancient times, but readers seeking enlightenment will surely be encouraged to learn that the unsettling Delphic effect is good for them.

Now his first and last works come together for the first time in print, in a collection aptly titled after his famous phrase, <i>We Are What We Pretend To Be</i>.<br><br> Written to be sold under the pseudonym of &#x201c;Mark Harvey,&#x201d; <i>Basic Training</i> was never published in Vonnegut&#x2019;s lifetime. It appears to have been written in the late 1940s and is therefore Vonnegut&#x2019;s first ever novella. It is a bitter, profoundly disenchanted story that satirizes the military, authoritarianism, gender relationships, parenthood and most of the assumed mid-century myths of the family. Haley Brandon, the adolescent protagonist, comes to the farm of his relative, the old crazy who insists upon being called The General, to learn to be a straight-shooting American. Haley&#x2019;s only means of survival will lead him to unflagging defiance of the General&#x2019;s deranged (but oh so American, oh so military) values. This story and its thirtyish author were no friends of the milieu to which the slick magazines&#x2019; advertisers were pitching their products.<br><br> When Vonnegut passed away in 2007, he left his last novel unfinished. Entitled <i>If God Were Alive Today</i>, this last work is a brutal satire on societal ignorance and carefree denial of the world&#x2019;s major problems. Protagonist Gil Berman is a middle-aged college lecturer and self-declared stand-up comedian who enjoys cracking jokes in front of a college audience while societal dependence on fossil fuels has led to the apocalypse. Described by Vonnegut as, &#x201c;the stand-up comedian on Doomsday,&#x201d; Gil is a character formed from Vonnegut&#x2019;s own rich experiences living in a reality Vonnegut himself considered inevitable.<br> <p>Along with the two works of fiction, Vonnegut&#x2019;s daughter, Nanette shares reminiscences about her father and commentary on these two works&#x2014;both exclusive to this edition.</p> In this fiction collection, published in print for the first time, exist Vonnegut&#x2019;s grand themes: trust no one, trust nothing; and the only constants are absurdity and resignation, which themselves cannot protect us from the void but might divert.</p><p><p>Kurt Vonnegut (1922-2007) is one of the most beloved American writers of the twentieth century. Vonnegut&#x2019;s audience increased steadily since his first five pieces in the 1950s and grew from there. His 1968 novel <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> has become a canonic war novel with Joseph Heller&#x2019;s <i>Catch-22</i> to form the truest and darkest of what came from World War II.<br><br> Vonnegut began his career as a science fiction writer, and his early novels--<i>Player Piano</i> and <i>The Sirens of Titan</i>--were categorized as such even as they appealed to an audience far beyond the reach of the category. In the 1960s, Vonnegut became closely associated with the Baby Boomer generation, a writer on that side, so to speak.<br><br> Now that Vonnegut&#x2019;s work has been studied as a large body of work, it has been more deeply understood and unified. There is a consistency to his satirical insight, humor and anger which makes his work so synergistic. It seems clear that the more of Vonnegut&#x2019;s work you read, the more it resonates and the more you wish to read. Scholars believe that Vonnegut&#x2019;s reputation (like Mark Twain&#x2019;s) will grow steadily through the decades as his work continues to increase in relevance and new connections are formed, new insights made.</p>"Nature", 10/24/13<br> "Vonnegut's first and last pieces are pervaded by his trademark dark humour."<br><br>"Hudson Valley News", 10/16/13<br> "Written forty years apart, these two pieces share the typical Vonnegut voice.

Koller is a scholar and teacher who has devoted his life to understanding Asian thought and practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote this text to give readers access to the rich philosophical and religious ideas of both South and East Asia.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Previously the second edition of Oriental Philosophies this book introduces and analyzes the major Asian philosophical and religious traditions and provides insights into the ways in which fundamental philosophical questions have been considered in Asia. Asian Philosophies includes quotations and examples directly from the philosophical and religious texts discussed. It also provides a pronunciation guide for Sanskrit, Chinese, and Japanese words. The third edition of Asian Philosophies has been revised to include new chapters on Islam and Jainism; the latest scholarship in Part II. Buddhist Philosophies; and new sections on the rectification of names, new examples from the Chuang Tzu, new quotations from the Lao Tzu, a clearer presentation of Neo-Confucianism, and a new section on post-Maoist thought in Part III. Chinese Philosophies. In addition, all chapters now include clarified explanations, new examples, and corrections based on recent scholarship. A valuable reference book for any reader wishing a deeper understanding of Asian philosophical and religious traditions.<p>In This Section:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I. Author Bio</p> <p>II. Author Letter</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <b> <p>I. Author Bio</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </b> John M. Koller is a Professor of Asian and Comparative Philosophy at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.&nbsp; His research areas include Buddhism and Psychoanalysis, and Philosophy of Religion.&nbsp; He is the author of more than fifty journal articles and chapters in edited books as well as five books.&nbsp; In addition, he is the recipient of several prestigious teaching awards:&nbsp; Selected Outstanding Educator of America, 1975; Named Outstanding World Philosopher, 2005; Wm. H. Wiley Distinguished Faculty Award, 1986; and Rensselaer Distinguished Teaching Fellow, 1990-92. &nbsp; &nbsp; <b> <p>II. Author Letter</p> </b><p><b> </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dear Colleague, </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Asian Philosophies introduces students to the main questions and methods of philosophy through a careful consideration of the major Asian philosophical traditions. It was written to help students answer three important questions. First, what are the key ideas that have shaped Asian cultures? Second, what are the fundamental values that have guided the lives of Asian peoples over the millennia? Third, how have the great thinkers of Asia thought about these ideas and values?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In trying to answer these questions, students learn how to think about and answer their own important philosophical questions: Who am I, What is the best way to live? What can we know? Thinking along with&#x2014;and sometimes against&#x2014;the great philosophers stimulates them to think more deeply and carefully about their own philosophical questions. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When I first started teaching, at St. Thomas University, my students and I examined only Western traditions, adopting as our guides Plato and Aristotle, Descartes and Hume and Sartre and Wittgenstein, philosophers who both I and my teachers at St. Thomas and the University of Chicago had found exciting. I learned that helping students find inspiring guides from among the great philosophers really opened their minds to the joys of philosophy. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Later, after my immersion in Asian philosophies at the East-West Center and the University of Hawaii, I was able to help my students choose as philosophical guides great philosophers from among the Asian traditions as well. At the University of Hawaii I was fortunate to have terrific teachers. Professors Chung-ying Cheng and Wing-tsit Chan introduced me to Chinese philosophy. Professor Kenneth Inada introduced me to Buddhist philosophy and Yasutani Roshi introduced me to zazen. Professor S.K. Saksena guided me through the intricacies of Indian philosophy for two wonderful years. Professors T.R.V. Murti, Kalidas Bhattacharya, and D.M. Datta were postgraduate mentors in India, while Professor George Artola and Babu Krishnacharya helped me learn Sanskrit.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In my books and articles, as in all of my teaching, I have tried to pass along to my students what I have been fortunate enough to have learned from my teachers, my colleagues and students. My experience in teaching at a variety of colleges &#x2013; as diverse as St. Thomas, Chaminade College, Colorado State University, Rensselaer Polytechnic, and SUNY Stony Brook &#x2013; has convinced me that teaching is primarily about motivating students to inquire and helping them learn, not about passing along information. <i>Asian Philosophies</i> attempts to help students ask and answer the big questions of life, which despite significant cultural differences are basically the same everywhere. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Studying the great philosophical traditions of Asia, makes it possible for us to understand these traditions&#x2019; carefully considered answers to the most important questions of life, answers that are supported by profound insights and good reasons. Because these answers have guided the thought and action of the peoples of Asia over the centuries, they provide the basic clues to the guiding ideas and values of Asian societies today. And in today&#x2019;s world, where the very future of humankind depends upon understanding and cooperation among people with diverse values and ideas, it is imperative that these values and ideas be understood.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I would be delighted to hear from anyone teaching or studying this book, and will gladly respond to your questions and concerns. And, of course, I would appreciate any suggestions for improvements. My email is kollej@rpi.edu.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>With my very best wishes,</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>John M.

I think the discovery/exploratory/problem solving approach is ABSOLUTELY the way this course should be taught, and of all the discrete books I have looked at, this text does the best job of supporting that kind of approach to the subject while still giving enough of the material in writing to fill in the gaps. ... I found that the material provided and the instructor notes cut down on my prep time, and I definitely referred to them.

But, over the past ten years, neoconservatism has become a force in criminology. Wilson, the leading advocate of this right-ward move, and Herrnstein, who is noted for his work on I.Q., race, and meritocracy, have written what should become the major source on this important development in criminology. Its moderate, Aristotelian behavioral theory is reminiscent of Edward Banfield's Unheavenly City Revisited and Ernest Van Den Haag's Punishing Criminals , but this book probably will have greater impact than either of these or any of Wilson's and Herrnstein's earlier writings. It will be praised by many and criticized by others who will complain that it does not expose the proper ``myths about crime,'' does not explain why ``the rich get richer and the poor get prison,'' and turns attention away from the corrupting influence of modern institutions.

In his first book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, he investigated the flip side of economic self-interest: the interest of the greater good. Smith?s classic work advances ideas about conscience, moral judgment, and virtue that have taken on renewed importance in business and politics.</p><p>Adam Smith&#39;s Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) lays the foundation for a general system of morals, and is a text of central importance in the history of moral and political thought. By means of the idea of sympathy and the mental construct of an impartial spectator, Smith formulated highly original theories of conscience, moral judgment and the virtues. This volume offers a new edition of the text with helpful notes for the student reader, together with a substantial introduction that sets the work in its philosophical and historical context.&#34;In The Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith assigned himself a difficult and dangerous task: to establish for educated men in an increasingly revolutionary age the reasonableness of morality and the necessity of the fruits of virtue - illustrated by the wisdom of the classical authors of antiquity. This book, Adam Smith&#39;s first, is, then, proof to skeptics of the importance of morality; and an antidote to those who think that free-market economics can be divorced from a moral society.&#34;--BOOK JACKET.</p><h2>Zondervan Illustrated Bible Backgrounds Commentary - Hebrews to Revelation Vol.4</h2><p>Brimming with lavish, full-color photos and graphics, the Zondervan Illustrated Bible Backgrounds Commentary walks you verse by verse through all the books of the New Testament.

But M.E. Braddon&#39;s classic novel of sensation uncovers the truth about its heroine in a plot involving bigamy, arson and murder. It challenges assumptions about the nature of femininity and investigates the narrow divide between sanity and insanity, using as its focus one of the most fascinating of all Victorian heroines. Combining elements of the detective novel, the psychological thriller and the romance of upper class life, Lady Audley&#39;s Secret was one of the most popular and successful novels of the nineteenth century.</p><p><p> <em>Lady Audley&#x2019;s Secret</em> (1862) was one of the most widely read novels in the Victorian period. The novel exemplifies &#x201c;sensation fiction&#x201d; in featuring a beautiful criminal heroine, an amateur detective, blackmail, arson, violence, and plenty of suspenseful action. To its contemporary readers, it also offered the thrill of uncovering blackmail and criminal violence within the homes of the upper class. The novel makes trenchant critiques of Victorian gender roles and social stereotypes, and it creates significant sympathy for the heroine, despite her criminal acts, as she suffers from the injustices of the &#x201c;marriage market&#x201d; and rebels against them. </p> <p> This Broadview edition includes a critical introduction and a broad selection of primary source material, including reproductions of the twenty-two woodcut illustrations from the <em>London Journal</em> serialization of the novel, extracts from two Victorian dramatizations of the work, satirical commentaries, and contemporary reviews. </p>With an Introduction by Catherine Wells-Cole</p><h2>William Empson: Essays on Shakespeare</h2><p>At the time of his death in 1984, the poet and critic William Empson was preparing and revising a collection of his essays on Shakespeare. This collection edited by David Pirie, is a book which the literary world has wanted for over half a century. Here, in a single volume, are major readings of Hamlet and Macbeth; a witty and sometimes impassioned defence of Falstaff, and a new piece on the architecture of the Globe theatre and other Renaissance playhouses, in which Empson explores the problems that the design of contemporary stages posed for a working playwright; there are also essays on the narrative poems, A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream and the last plays. The essays demonstrate the subtlety and agility of Empson&#39;s mind, as well as his remarkable breadth of knowledge, while the almost racy wit of his informal prose style argues for a literary criticism which should never become solemn if it is to be truly serious.</p><p>Featuring major analyses of Hamlet and Macbeth, this collection of the late critic&#39;s works encompasses recent advances in Shakespearian scholarship; a witty and passionate defense of Falstaff; and an original essay on Renaissance playhouse architecture.At the time of his death in 1984, William Empson was preparing and revising a collection of his essays on Shakespeare.

Their domestic resources of virtually unlimited supplies of fish and game, furs, wool, wood and iron, together with their skilled craftsmanship, refined artistic sensibilities, social and political organization, adventurousness and bravery, allowed the Vikings to make their influence felt all over Europe for almost 300 years.<br>This book also tells the story of how the Scandinavian countries became Christian nations and entered into the full community of Christian Europe, receiving and giving to the civilization of Europe.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Danish, French, German, Norwegian, Russian, SwedishA complete picture of world history requires examination of the Arctic between Newfoundland and Russia, including the Vikings. Other books on Viking society are available, but few are as comprehensive as this international effort. Published to coincide with a a major exhibition traveling to Paris, Berlin, and Copenhagen, this book offers enough material to close the sizable bibliographic gap that currently exists. The only real weakness is the uneven quality of the writing, which, as a result of the large number of contributors, can perhaps be forgiven. What libraries get for their money is a well-rounded view of Nordic culture, a complete catalog of artifacts in the exhibit, color illustrations, maps, and fascinating information not found elsewhere.

This volume, however, consists of a single story, often considered the most exciting of all Corbett&#39;s jungle tales. He gives a carefully-detailed account of a notorious leopard that terrorized life in the hills of the colonial United Provinces. This story represents Corbett&#39;s most sustained and unique effort.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Jim Corbett</strong> was a renowned hunter.<br>It is unfair that Sir Jim Corbett, along with his phenomenal hunting dexterity, was fantastically skilled at writing and narrating events. I understand that Jungle and Animal related events can by themselves create a sort of affinity with the reader, but having said that, i would not like to take credit away from Sir Corbett for his gripping expression of the events that took place while he was on the trail of the Rudraprayag Man Eating Leopard. The engaging writing made everything seem so real, as if watching someone from my window. --By Darpan on 26 March 2014<br><br>Thrilling experience. After reading this book I concluded that his name is deserve to given one of the National Parks in India for his service to Innocent people of those days. He risked his life so many times to save those rudraprayaga area people from man eating leopard. --By Dileep K. on 22 November 2016<br><br>Jim Corbett is one of those few writers who have a natural talent for writing. Reading this book was amazing and it was very hard to put down. Feels just like you are actually present there with Corbett in first person.

Many who&#x2019;ve turned away from religious institutions&#x2014;and others who have lived wholly without religion&#x2014;hunger for more than what contemporary secular life has to offer but are reluctant to follow organized religion&#x2019;s strict and often inflexible path to spirituality. In&nbsp;<i>A Religion of One&#x2019;s Own</i>, bestselling author and former monk Thomas Moore explores the myriad possibilities of creating a personal spiritual style, either inside or outside formal religion.<br>&nbsp;<br>Two decades ago, Moore&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Care of the Soul</i>&nbsp;touched a chord with millions of readers yearning to integrate spirituality into their everyday lives. In&nbsp;<i>A Religion of One&#x2019;s Own</i>, Moore expands on the topics he first explored shortly after leaving the monastery. He recounts the benefits of contemplative living that he learned during his twelve years as a monk but also the more original and imaginative spirituality that he later developed and embraced in his secular life. Here, he shares stories of others who are creating their own path: a former football player now on a spiritual quest with the Pueblo Indians, a friend who makes a meditative practice of floral arrangements, and a well-known classical pianist whose audiences sometimes describe having a mystical experience while listening to her performances. Moore weaves their experiences with the wisdom of philosophers, writers, and artists who have rejected materialism and infused their secular lives with transcendence.<br>&nbsp;<br>At a time when so many feel disillusioned with or detached from organized religion yet long for a way to move beyond an exclusively materialistic, rational lifestyle,&nbsp;<i>A Religion of One&#x2019;s Own</i>&nbsp;points the way to creating an amplified inner life and a world of greater purpose, meaning, and reflection.</p><p><b>Thomas Moore</b>&nbsp;was a monk for twelve years, a musician, a university professor, and a psychotherapist.

Vegetarian Buddhists may eat only three types of seafood--mussels, claims, and oysters. The turnip cakes enjoyed at the Lunar New Year are a symbol that good fortune is rising, and so on. She insists on and explains the gathering together of the right stuff and learning the right techniques; a carbon-steel wok and cleaver, for example, are the two critical pieces of equipment in Chinese cooking. The best part of the book are the dishes--some tied to tradition, others the product of Lo's imagination. The need for exotic ingredients, from buckthorn seeds to red dates, may be the only deterrent to reader-cooks. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i>Yin-Fei Lo, an authority on Chinese cooking and author of several other cookbooks, presents dozens of delicious and unusual Chinese vegetarian dishes. Some are recipes from her childhood and family, others are the "real" versions of dishes served in Chinese American recipes, and still others are her versions of classic dishes or her own innovations, often using ingredients not traditionally available in China.

They are true organisms,spiritually conceived; works of art, using the best technology by inspiration rather than the idiosyncrasies of mere taste or any averaging by the committee mind.</i> <br>&#x2014;Frank Lloyd Wright</blockquote> <p>The Java&#x2122; programming language has been warmly received by the world community of software developers and Internet content providers. Users of the Internet and World Wide Web benefit from access to secure, platform-independent applications that can come from anywhere on the Internet. Software developers who create applications in the Java programming language benefit by developing code only once, with no need to &#x201c;port&#x201d; their applications to every software and hardware platform.</p> <p>For many, the language was known first as a tool to create applets for the World Wide Web. An <i>applet</i> is a mini-application that runs inside a Web page. An applet can perform tasks and interact with users on their browser pages without using resources from the Web server after being downloaded. Some applets may, of course, talk with the server to do their job, but that&#x2019;s their business.</p> <p>The Java programming language is indeed valuable for distributed network environments like the Web. However, it goes well beyond this domain to provide a powerful general-purpose programming language suitable for building a variety of applications that either do not depend on network features or want them for different reasons. The ability to execute downloaded code on remote hosts in a secure manner is a critical requirement for many organizations.</p> <p>Other groups use it as a general-purpose programming language for projects in which machine independence is less important. Ease of programming and safety features help you quickly produce working code. Some common programming errors never occur because of features like garbage collection and type-safe references. Support for multithreading caters to modern network-based and graphical user interface-based applications that must attend to multiple tasks simultaneously, and the mechanisms of exception handling ease the task of dealing with error conditions. While the built-in tools are powerful, it is a simple language in which programmers can quickly become proficient.</p> <p>The Java programming language is designed for maximum portability with as few implementation dependencies as possible. An int, for example, is a 32-bit signed two&#x2019;s-complement integer in all implementations, irrespective of the CPU architecture on which the program executes. Defining everything possible about the language and its runtime environment enables users to run compiled code anywhere and share code with anyone who has a Java runtime environment.</p> <p><b>About This Book</b></p> <p>This book teaches the Java programming language to people who are familiar with basic programming concepts. It explains the language without being arduously formal or complete. This book is not an introduction to object-oriented programming, although some issues are covered to establish a common terminology. Other books in this series and much online documentation focus on applets, graphical interfaces, Web sites, databases, components, and other specific kinds of programming tasks. For other references, see &#x201c;Further Reading&#x201d; on page 755.</p> <p>This fourth edition provides integrated coverage of the Java programming language as provided by the Java&#x2122; 2 Platform Standard Edition 5.0 and specified by the <i>Java&#x2122; Language Specification, Third Edition.</i> It also covers most of the classes in the main packages (java.lang, java.util, java.io) as implemented in the J2SE&#x2122; Development Kit 5.0 (more commonly known as JDK 5.0, or in the older nomenclature JDK 1.5.0). </p> <p>If you have already read the third edition of this book, you will find some major changes, both in the language and the book, since the 1.3 release that the third edition covered. There are new chapters on generics, enums, and annotations&#x2014;the major new language features introduced in the 5.0 release&#x2014;and major new sections on assertions and regular expressions. Some existing material has been restructured to accommodate other changes and to improve the general flow of the text&#x2014;such as introducing the new boxing and unboxing conversions. But every single chapter has been updated in some way, whether it is a new language feature like variable argument methods; the new enhanced for loop construct; a new class such as Formatter for formatting text output; or changes to classes and methods caused by the addition of generics (such as the collections utilities and the reflection classes)&#x2014;change permeates this entire fourth edition.</p> <p>The Java programming language shares many features common to most programming languages in use today. The language should look familiar to C and C++ programmers because it was designed with C and C++ constructs where the languages are similar. That said, this book is neither a comparative analysis nor a &#x201c;bridge&#x201d; tutorial&#x2014;no knowledge of C or C++ is assumed. C++ programmers, especially, may be as hindered by what they must unlearn as they are helped by their knowledge.</p> <p>Chapter 1&#x2014;<i>A Quick Tour</i>&#x2014;gives a quick overview of the language. Programmers who are unfamiliar with object-oriented programming notions should read the quick tour, while programmers who are already familiar with object-oriented programming paradigms will find the quick tour a useful introduction to the object-oriented features of the language. The quick tour introduces some of the basic language features on which examples through the rest of the book are built.</p> <p>Chapters 2 through 6 cover the object-oriented core features of the language, namely, class declarations that define components of a program, and objects manufactured according to class definitions. Chapter 2&#x2014;<i>Classes and Objects</i>&#x2014;describes the basis of the language: classes. Chapter 3&#x2014;<i>Extending Classes</i>&#x2014;describes how an existing class can be <i>extended,</i> or <i>subclassed,</i> to create a new class with additional data and behavior. Chapter 4&#x2014;<i>Interfaces</i>&#x2014;describes how to declare interface types that are abstract descriptions of behavior that provide maximum flexibility for class designers and implementors. Chapter 5&#x2014;<i>Nested Classes and Interfaces</i>&#x2014;describes how classes and interfaces can be declared inside other classes and interfaces, and the benefits that provides. Finally, Chapter 6&#x2014;<i>Enumeration Types</i>&#x2014;covers the definition and use of type-safe enumeration constants.</p> <p>Chapters 7 through 10 cover standard constructs common to most languages. Chapter 7&#x2014;<i>Tokens, Values, and Variables</i>&#x2014;describes the tokens of the language from which statements are constructed, the types defined by the language and their allowed values, and the variables that store data in objects, arrays, or locally within methods. Chapter 8&#x2014;<i>Primitives as Types</i>&#x2014;explores the relationship between the primitive types and objects of their corresponding wrapper classes, and how boxing and unboxing can transparently convert between them. Chapter 9&#x2014;<i>Operators and Expressions</i>&#x2014;describes the basic operators of the language, how these operators are used to build expressions, and how expressions are evaluated. Chapter 10&#x2014;<i>Control Flow</i>&#x2014;describes how control statements direct the order of statement execution.</p> <p>Chapter 11&#x2014;<i>Generic Types</i>&#x2014;describes generic types: how they are written and used, their power, and their limitations.</p> <p>Chapter 12&#x2014;<i>Exceptions and Assertions</i>&#x2014;describes the language&#x2019;s powerful error-handling capabilities, and the use of assertions to validate the expected behavior of code.</p> <p>Chapter 13&#x2014;<i>Strings and Regular Expressions</i>&#x2014;describes the built-in language and runtime support for String objects, the underlying character set support, and the powerful utilities for regular expression matching.</p> <p>Chapter 14&#x2014;<i>Threads</i>&#x2014;explains the language&#x2019;s view of multithreading. Many applications, such as graphical interface-based software, must attend to multiple tasks simultaneously. These tasks must cooperate to behave correctly, and threads meet the needs of cooperative multitasking.</p> <p>Chapter 15&#x2014;<i>Annotations</i>&#x2014;describes the annotation types used to document some of the extra-linguistic properties of classes and method.</p> <p>Chapter 16&#x2014;<i>Reflection</i>&#x2014;describes the runtime type introspection mechanism and how you can construct and manipulate objects of unknown type dynamically at runtime.</p> <p>Chapter 17&#x2014;<i>Garbage Collection and Memory</i>&#x2014;talks about garbage collection, finalization, and lower-strength reference objects.</p> <p>Chapter 18&#x2014;<i>Packages</i>&#x2014;describes how you can group collections of classes and interfaces into separate packages.</p> <p>Chapter 19&#x2014;<i>Documentation Comments</i>&#x2014;shows how to write reference documentation in comments.</p> <p>Chapters 20 through 24 cover the main packages. Chapter 20&#x2014;<i>The I/O Package</i>&#x2014;describes the input/output system, which is based on streams. Chapter 21&#x2014;<i>Collections</i>&#x2014;covers the collection or container classes such as sets and lists. Chapter 22&#x2014;<i>Miscellaneous Utilities</i>&#x2014;covers the rest of the utility classes such as bit sets, formatted output, text scanning, and random number generation. Chapter 23&#x2014;<i>System Programming</i>&#x2014;leads you through the system classes that provide access to features of the underlying platform. Chapter 24&#x2014;<i>Internationalization and Localization</i>&#x2014;covers some of the tools used to create programs that can run in many linguistic and cultural environments.</p> <p>Chapter 25&#x2014;<i>Standard Packages</i>&#x2014;briefly explores the packages that are part of the standard platform, giving overviews of those packages not covered in more detail in this book.</p> <p>Appendix A&#x2014;<i>Application Evolution</i>&#x2014;looks at some of the issues involved in dealing with the evolution of applications and the Java platform, and the impact this has on some of the new language features.</p> <p>Appendix B&#x2014;<i>Useful Tables</i>&#x2014;has tables of information that you may find useful for quick reference.</p> <p>Finally, <i>Further Reading</i> lists works that may be interesting for further reading on complete details, object orientation, programming with threads, software design, and other topics.</p> <p><b>Examples and Documentation</b></p> <p>All the code examples in the text have been compiled and run on the latest version of the language available at the time the book was written, which was the JDK 1.5.0_02 product version. Only supported features are covered&#x2014;deprecated types, methods, and fields are ignored except when unavoidable or when knowledge of the past is necessary to understand the present. We have also covered issues beyond writing programs that simply compile. Part of learning a language is to learn to use it well. For this reason, we have tried to show principles of good programming style and design.</p> <p>In a few places we refer to online documentation. Development environments provide a way to automatically generate documentation (usually HTML documents) for a compiled class from its documentation comments. This documentation is normally viewed with a Web browser.</p> <blockquote> <i>Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results.

This stirring fable captures a new spirit of Christianity--where personal, daily interaction with God is more important than institutional church structures, where faith is more about a way of life than a system of belief, where being authentically good is more important than being doctrinally "right," and where one's direction is more important than one's present location. Brian McLaren's delightful account offers a wise and wondrous approach for revitalizing Christian spiritual life and Christian congregations.</p> <p>If you are interested in joining a discussion group devoted to a <i>A New Kind of Christian</i> please visit <b>groups.yahoo.com/group/NKOC</b>.</p></p><p>"Finally, an approach to Christianity that walks its walk by presenting Jesus' message of unconditional love in an open and non-threatening way. <i>A New Kind of Christian</i> offers tremendous tools for breaking down walls built fromprevious experiences with judgmental and fear-based religion." --Kim Corbin, Skipping activist and founder of iskip.comFor all those who are burned out on church or who want to be spiritual without being &#34;religious,&#34; A New Kind of Christian offers a tale of spiritual renewal that both instructs and inspires. After many years as a church planter and pastor, author Brian McLaren has found-as more and more Christians are finding-that neither the conservative evangelical nor the liberal mainline stream of Christianity fully expresses his own developing faith. McLaren&#39;s engaging story gives voice to this emerging understanding of what it can mean to be a Christian in these dynamic times, offering a constructive vision of what a postmodern Christian might look like. A New Kind of Christian recounts a lively and intimate conversation between a pastor and his daughter&#39;s high school science teacher, in which they reflect together about faith, doubt, reason, mission, leadership, and spiritual practice in the emerging postmodern world. The pastor is forced to grapple with the deeper source of his dissatisfaction with Christianity as he has understood, practiced, and taught it -his reluctance to let go of the &#34;modern model&#34; of Christianity. Ultimately, he comes to understand that beyond the constricted categories, cliched rhetoric, and rigid mechanisms of modern Christianity lies a new possibility: a revitalized and vibrant faith that explores and expresses the teachings and mission of Jesus in a fresh, engaging way for third-millennium people. The author reminds us that this is but the beginning of the journey, and &#34;whatever a new kind of Christian is, no one is one yet. . . . But every transformation has to start somewhere.&#34; For all who are searching for a deeper life with God and a more honest statement of authentic Christian faith, A New Kind of Christian will open the way for an exciting spiritual adventure into new territory and new ways of believing, belonging, and becoming. Brian McLaren is the founding pastor of Cedar Ridge Community Church in the Washington-Baltimore area and the author of two previous books on contemporary Christianity, including The Church on the Other Side: Doing Ministry in the Postmodern Matrix (2000).</p><h2>Introduction to Animal Science (5th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Introduction to Animal Science: Global, Biological, Social, and Industry Perspectives, Fifth Edition,</i> </b>features the most comprehensive, up-to-date coverage of the traditional disciplines that are so essential to a solid foundation in Animal Science: nutrition, digestion, feeds, genetics, reproduction, disease, and animal behavior.

This beautifully illustrated volume spans the breadth of Palermo&#x2019;s brief but significant career and explores each phase, beginning with objects and paintings created shortly after he graduated from Joseph Beuys&#x2019;s class at the D�sseldorf Art Academy in the early 1960s and culminating with paintings he produced during his last years in both Germany and New York City.</p><p>Palermo&#x2019;s oeuvre is customarily divided into four principal groupings: the Objects; the Cloth Pictures (<i>Stoffbilder</i>), the <i>in situ</i> Wall Paintings and Drawings, and the late Metal Pictures, including the epic <i>To the People of New York City</i> (1976), now in the collection of Dia Art Foundation. <i>Blinky Palermo</i> also addresses the artist&#x2019;s works on paper, including watercolors, sketches, preparatory studies, and prints that he made throughout his career.</p><p>Essays by distinguished authors position the artist&#x2019;s work in relation to postwar American art and culture, which he greatly revered. Topics include the influence of the American milieu on the Metal Pictures; space and time in the Wall Drawings and Paintings; and the insights into Palermo&#x2019;s concerns and process afforded by his works on paper. The most comprehensive volume on Palermo&#x2019;s career to date, this important book offers a rare opportunity to explore in-depth the work of a remarkably innovative artist, pointing to Palermo&#x2019;s relevance and influence on a new generation of artists.</p></p><p><b>Benjamin H.

Beginning with a detailed introduction to the classical theory of groups, Dr. Weyl continues with an account of the fundamental results of quantum physics. There follows a rigorous investigation of the relations holding between the mathematical and physical theories.<br>Topics covered include: unitary geometry, quantum theory (Schr�dinger's wave equation, transition probabilities, directional quantization, collision phenomena, Zeeman and Stark effects); groups and their representations (sub-groups and conjugate classes, linear transformations, rotation and Lorentz groups, closed continuous groups, invariants and covariants, Lie's theory); applications of group theory to quantum mechanics (simple state and term analysis, the spinning electron, multiplet structure, energy and momentum, Pauli exclusion principle, problem of several bodies, Maxwell-Dirac field equations, etc.); the symmetric permutation group; and algebra of symmetric transformation (invariant sub-spaces in group and tensor space, sub-groups, Young's symmetry operators, spin and valence, group theoretic classification of atomic spectra, branching laws, etc).<br>Throughout, Dr. Weyl emphasizes the "reciprocity" between representations of the symmetric permutation group and those of the complete linear group. His simplified treatment of "reciprocity," the Clebsch-Gordan series, and the Jordan-H�lder theorem and its analogues, has helped to clarity these and other complex topics.</p><p>Along with his fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, Hermann Weyl (1885-1955) took a serious interest in theoretical physics. In addition to teaching in Z�rich, G�ttingen, and Princeton, Weyl worked with Einstein on relativity theory at the Institute for Advanced Studies.<p><b>Hermann Weyl: The Search for Beautiful Truths&nbsp; <br></b>One of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century, Hermann Weyl (1885&#x2013;1955) was associated with three major institutions during his working years: the ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), the University of Gottingen, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

The personalities and events of Roman history have become part of the West's cultural lexicon, and Woolf provides brilliant retellings of each of these, from the war with Carthage to Octavian's victory over Cleopatra, from the height of territorial expansion under the emperors Trajan and Hadrian to the founding of Constantinople and the barbarian invasions which resulted in Rome's ultimate collapse. Throughout, Woolf carefully considers the conditions that made Rome's success possible and so durable, covering topics as diverse as ecology, slavery, and religion. Woolf also compares Rome to other ancient empires and to its many later imitators, bringing into vivid relief the Empire's most distinctive and enduring features.<br><br>As Woolf demonstrates, nobody ever planned to create a state that would last more than a millennium and a half, yet Rome was able, in the end, to survive barbarian migrations, economic collapse and even the conflicts between a series of world religions that had grown up within its borders, in the process generating an image and a myth of empire that is apparently indestructible. Based on new research and compellingly told, this sweeping account promises to eclipse all previously published histories of the empire.<br></p><p><br><strong>Greg Woolf</strong> is Professor of Ancient History at the University of St Andrews. He is the author of <em>Et Tu, Brute?: A Short History of Political Murder </em>and editor of <em>The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Roman World</em>.<br><br>"This latest volume from Professor Greg Woolf is a marvelous synthesis of the scholarship of, primarily, the last four decades on Rome's imperial successes and failures, rendered in an approachable and affable style of writing that is imbued throughout with useful anecdotes, quotes from primary sources, and summaries of the major scholarly positions. Woolf draws together rather complex lines of inquiry from numerous fields (including ecological and socio-political disciplines) and pieces together a narrative that educates, and points the reader to new theoretical directions that can be used to further illuminate the study of the topic at hand. ... Woolf has produced a useful review of the positions on Roman imperialism, a tour-de-force summary of the evolution of Rome from city-state to center of imperial power, and a really good read." --<em>New England Classical Journal</em><p></p><br>"In this passionately told exploration of the history of Rome, Woolf peers closely at what enabled Rome to resist defeats and capitalize on victories, and how it evolved to face new needs and new threats. With dazzling detail, Woolf retells the long story from Rome's birth in 753 B.C.E. to the republic, the empire, and the empire's fall" --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Excellent...Understanding the history of Rome is not a simple task...for those already with such an interest, Woolf's book will be a joy to read. For those not yet intrigued by Rome, it may well set them on that path." --Adrian Goldsworthy, <em>The National Interest</em><p></p><br>"Exceptionally interesting and provocative reading." --Jonathan Yardley, <em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"Could [this] be the best single-volume introduction to the history of ancient Rome? It is conceptual yet avoids the pitfalls of overgeneralizing, a difficult balance to strike. It also has a superb (useful rather than exhaustive) bibliography. A good measure of books such as this is whether they induce you to read or order other books on the same topic and this one did. A sure thing to make my 'Best Books of 2012' list." --Tyler Cowen, <em>Marginal Revolution</em> <br><p></p><br>"This is a marvellous book. Woolf provides a sweeping history of Rome's rise and fall, and asks the big questions of why and how this happened. Better yet, he offers no simple or simplistic answers, but instead well considered discussion of the evidence and how we try to understand it." --Adrian Goldsworthy, author of <em>How Rome Fell: Death of a Superpower</em> and <em>Caesar: Life of a Colossus</em> <br><p></p><br>"Explanations for how Rome came to bestride the Mediterranean world puzzled ancient no less than modern historians, and Woolf's attention to enduring preoccupations, as with the fall of the republic and its succession by the emperors, endows his treatment with debate-like liveliness...a fine foundation for further learning about the Roman Empire." --<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"How a single-volume history of Rome could contain so much is beyond me. Ranging across time and space, and examining every facet of Roman civilization, it also places Rome's empire in the context of empires elsewhere, from China to Peru. Woolf has written what will surely establish itself as the definitive introduction to his subject." --Tom Holland, author of <em>Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic</em> and <em>Persian Fire: The First World Empire and the Battle for the West</em><p></p><br><em>Rome: An Empire's Story</em> is a terrific piece of work. It covers a vast chronological sweep briskly, from a wide and revealing variety of perspectives, and with a dazzling intellectual verve. The reader repeatedly encounters shrewd and often unexpected insights all along the way. Greg Woolf has given us a real tour de force of a book." --Nathan Rosenstein, Professor of History at The Ohio State University and author of <em>Rome and the Mediterranean, 290 to 146 BC</em><p></p><br>"How the Roman elite shaped an identity for itself and its many subjects is one theme of Greg Woolf's <em>Rome: An Empire's Story,</em> a remarkable work of synthesis that describes the rise, flourishing and decline of the Roman Empire...textbooks divide Roman history into the republican and imperial periods and fix the beginning of the empire proper to the age of Augustus. Not the least merit of Mr. Woolf's chronicle is its depiction of how misleading this division can be..." --<em>Wall Street Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"Fifteen years ago, Greg Woolf published one of the best books ever written on the western Roman Empire (<em>Becoming Roman</em>). His new account of Rome's imperial history is hence something of an event....[a] grand new vision of the Roman empire." --<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Early Modern European Society</h2><p><p>Drawing together common features of society from a range of different contexts throughout Europe, from Italy and Spain to Poland and Russia, <em>Early Modern European Society</em> surveys the sweeping changes affecting Europe from the end of the fifteenth century to the early decades of the eighteenth century. </p> <p>Henry Kamen includes discussion on:</p> <ul> <li>European identities, frontiers and language</li> <li>leisure, work and migration</li> <li>religion, ritual and witchcraft</li> <li>the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie and the poor</li> <li>gender roles</li> <li>social discipline and absolutism.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>Henry Kamen is Professor of the Higher Council for Scientific Research, Barcelona, Spain.

It would be an excellent book for undergraduate students, and yet its caliber and clarity make it useful to researchers and other historians.... These 10 chapters present a thorough, readable, and informative overview of early modern society. Although each paragraph is densely packed with information and analysis, the work is not beyond the reach of undergraduates or the general public.

Mathematicians and artists have long been on a quest to understand the physical world they see before them and the abstract objects they know by thought alone. Taking readers on a tour of the practice of mathematics and the philosophical ideas that drive the discipline, Lynn Gamwell points out the important ways mathematical concepts have been expressed by artists. Sumptuous illustrations of artworks and cogent math diagrams are featured in Gamwell's comprehensive exploration.</p><p>Gamwell begins by describing mathematics from antiquity to the Enlightenment, including Greek, Islamic, and Asian mathematics. Then focusing on modern culture, Gamwell traces mathematicians' search for the foundations of their science, such as David Hilbert's conception of mathematics as an arrangement of meaning-free signs, as well as artists' search for the essence of their craft, such as Aleksandr Rodchenko's monochrome paintings. She shows that self-reflection is inherent to the practice of both modern mathematics and art, and that this introspection points to a deep resonance between the two fields: Kurt G�del posed questions about the nature of mathematics in the language of mathematics and Jasper Johns asked "What is art?" in the vocabulary of art. Throughout, Gamwell describes the personalities and cultural environments of a multitude of mathematicians and artists, from Gottlob Frege and Beno�t Mandelbrot to Max Bill and Xu Bing.</p><p><i>Mathematics and Art</i> demonstrates how mathematical ideas are embodied in the visual arts and will enlighten all who are interested in the complex intellectual pursuits, personalities, and cultural settings that connect these vast disciplines.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Mathematics and Art</i> describes mankind's search for patterns and the expression of these numbers and forms by artists. This book will enrich the reader's understanding of mathematics and the arts throughout history, and their deep interconnections in today's global culture of high technology and contemporary art."<b>--Tatsuo Miyajima, artist</b></p><p>"Lynn Gamwell is a singular intellect and this is a singular book. Her text weaves together philosophy, art, science, and mathematics in their historical settings. The illustrations are absolutely stunning. Her eye for the juxtaposition of art images, math diagrams, text, and marginal quotations makes turning every page a delight. Each chapter leaves the reader with a sense of beauty, insight, and truth."<b>--Eric Heller, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Often artists understand how to make art but not what to make, and for centuries, artists have looked toward nature for subject matter and inspiration. Leonardo advised, &#x2018;Don't copy nature. Follow the ways of nature.' Everything in nature, from plants and atoms to crystals and cosmology, can be predicted through mathematics, and a visual study of the intersection between mathematics and art history has long been needed. This book beautifully satisfies that need."<b>--Dorothea Rockburne, artist</b></p><p>"Handsomely illustrated and containing a wealth of information, this book is a must for anyone interested in the relations between science, nature, mathematics, and art. It is destined to become a classic on par with E. H. Gombrich's landmark work <i>The Sense of Order</i>."<b>--Eli Maor, author of <i>e: The Story of a Number</i></b></p><p>"This impressive work is a must for anyone interested in the interactions between mathematical ideas and art, and in particular the ways in which, throughout history, mathematical ideas have inspired painters, sculptors, and architects. Few books dealing with this complex topic achieve such a degree of accomplishment and clarity as Gamwell's handsome volume does."<b>--Leo Corry, author of <i>A Brief History of Numbers</i></b></p><p>"Many contemporary artists feel a deep connection to mathematics and computer science. In this book, Lynn Gamwell traces the origin of this connection and describes why it is particularly strong in artists, like myself, who are from a European culture."<b>--Manfred Mohr, artist</b></p><p>"Having spent many decades putting mathematics into visual form for a new understanding of it in my art, I recommend this thoroughly researched and well-written book for students to immerse themselves in mathematics' intricacies, rich history, precision, and yes, wonders."<b>--Agnes Denes, artist</b></p><p>"In this book, Lynn Gamwell provides a marvelous exploration of the development of symbols and diagrams, and shows how this helps us to better understand the rich connections between art and mathematics."<b>--Dick Termes, internationally acclaimed artist</b></p><p>"This book stands alone in describing how art has been inspired by mathematics. With its lavish illustrations, it has a stunning visual impact and Lynn Gamwell does a masterful job of providing a history of mathematics and art, and how they are intertwined. From ancient works to modern abstract expressionism, the book's many colorful artworks are mesmerizing. This is an important reference for anyone interested in mathematics or art."<b>--Edward Belbruno, Princeton University</b></p><p>"With intelligent writing and abundant illustrations, Lynn Gamwell's book presents a kaleidoscope of art related to math and physics. The global breadth of the work discussed spans from antiquity to modernity and reflects a courageous vision, resulting in a tremendous resource for scientists and artists alike."<b>--Claire and Helaman Ferguson, coauthors of <i>Helaman Ferguson: Mathematics in Stone and Bronze</i></b></p><p>"Delving into this remarkable and profusely illustrated book is akin to slipping into a seminar on two areas--art and mathematics--that are often thought of as being at odds. Instead, Lynn Gamwell eloquently links the artist and the mathematician, as she traces the cultural history of their interconnected disciplines. You will find yourself coming back to these pages, again and again, to reread part of a chapter or to savor certain passages and images."<b>--Richard Waller, executive director of the University of Richmond Museums</b></p><p>"There is increasing interest in the intersection of mathematics and art, and this wonderful book shows that mathematicians and artists have been inspiring each other for a long time. All who are interested in these two fields--as well as many who believe they are interested in one but not the other--will be enthralled."<b>--Robert Bosch, Oberlin College</b></p><p>"This well-written and interesting book links the philosophical views of different periods to trends in mathematics, philosophy of mathematics, and cutting-edge art.

The past, the present, and the future of our country have been his preoccupation during an artistic career spanning more than half a century. This volume, produced with the active cooperation of the artist, places before the reader the entire exciting panorama of Benton&#39;s work, including many pictures never before published.Benton approaches his subjects with the same verve that Renaissance artists brought to their historic and human themes. If his stylistic roots can be traced to Michelangelo and the Mannerists, his brilliant painterly approach is rooted in his own personality and his native ambience.After a brief involvement with the academies and the isms of theParisian milieu, Benton began to concentrate on the American scene and the American experience. He journeyed through the country, pencil and brush at the ready; to an eagerly responsive public his lively, atmospheric drawings and paintings, with their swinging rhytbns and spirited compositions, demonstrated that American life was a subject of real artistic vitality. And, because he believed that the mural can encompass the greatest amount of that life, its drama, energy, and force he favored this medium, becoming a major figure in the history of American mural painting. Prominently featured in this book are the famous Benton murals painted for the New School for Social Research and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, for the State of Indiana, for the Missouri State Capitol, and for the Municipal Building in Joplin. A number are reproduced in large foldouts...... The magnificent illustrations, almost half in full color, present a vista of America that is uniquely Thomas Hart Benton&#39;s and, by virtue of his artistic integrity, uniquely American. Added textual features of the volume are a full chronology and a selected bibliography. 22p illustrations, including 101 plates in full color.</p><p></p><h2>Principles of Environmental Engineering &amp; Science</h2><p><i>Principles of Environmental Engineering</i>is intended for a course in introductory environmental engineering for sophomore- or junior-level students. <b>This text provides a background in fundamental science and engineering principles of environmental engineering</b> for students who may or may not become environmental engineers. <p><i>Principles</i> places more emphasis on scientific principles, ethics, and safety, and focuses less on engineering design. <b>The text exposes students to a broad range of environmental topics</b>&#x2015;including risk management, water quality an treatment, air pollution, hazardous waste, solid waste, and ionizing radiation as well as discussion of relevant regulations and practices. </p><p>The book also uses mass and energy balance as a tool for understanding environmental processes and solving environmental engineering problems. </p><p>This new edition includes an optional chapter on Biology as well as a thorough updating of environmental standards and a discussion of how those standards are created.</p></p><p>Mackenzie L.

F. Scott Fitzgerald was twenty-six when he wrote this lament to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, in 1923 - two years before Scribners published The Great Gatsby. Soon after Gatsby appeared, Fitzgerald wrote to H. L. Mencken, "I think the book is so far a commercial failure - at least it was two weeks after publication - hadn't reached 20,000 yet."<br>Gatsby turned out all right in the end. But while Fitzgerald's roller-coaster reputation fell precipitously in the years approaching his death in 1940, his stature in American literature has risen steadily in the five decades that followed - the strongest restoration in American literary history. Yet his life and work have remained obscured by myth and misconceptions. In this new collection of his letters, edited by leading Fitzgerald scholar and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, we see through his own words the artistic and emotional maturation of one of America's most enduring and elegant authors. A Life in Letters is the most comprehensive volume of Fitzgerald's letters - many of them appearing in print for the first time. The fullness of the selection and the chronological arrangement make this collection the closest thing to an autobiography Fitzgerald ever wrote.<br>While many readers are familiar with Fitzgerald's legendary "jazz age" social life and his friendships with Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Edmund Wilson, and other famous authors, few are aware of his writings about his life and his views on writing. Letters to his editor Maxwell Perkins illustrate the development of Fitzgerald's literary sensibility; those to his friend and competitor Ernest Hemingway reveal their difficult friendship. The most poignant letters here were written to his wife, Zelda, from the time of their courtship in Montgomery, Alabama, during World War I to her extended convalescence in a sanatorium near Asheville, North Carolina. Fitzgerald is by turns affectionate and proud in his letters to his daughter, Scottie, at college in the East while he was struggling in Hollywood.<br>For readers who think primarily of Fitzgerald as a hard-drinking playboy for whom writing was effortless, these letters show his serious, painstaking concerns with creating realistic, durable art. A Life in Letters offers a full, vibrant self-portrait of an artist whose work was his life.</p><p>This volume properly includes a high proportion of letters about writing. The most important thing about Fitzgerald--about any writer--is his witing.<strong>F. Scott Fitzgerald </strong>was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1896, attended Princeton University, and published his first novel,<i> This Side of Paradise</i>, in 1920. That same year he married Zelda Sayre and the couple divided their time among New York, Paris, and the Riviera, becoming a part of the American expatriate circle that included Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and John Dos Passos. Fitzgerald was a major new literary voice, and his masterpieces include <i>The</i> <i>Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby, </i>and <i>Tender Is the Night</i>. He died of a heart attack in 1940 at the age of forty-four, while working on <i>The Love of the Last Tycoon</i>. For his sharp social insight and breathtaking lyricism, Fitzgerald is known as one of the most important American writers of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Fiber Optic Test and Measurement</h2><p><p> <b> </b>This is the most authoritative, complete source of test and measurement information for engineers who design and maintain fiber optic networks.<b> </b>This book presents measurement principles for characterizing all three basic components of a fiber optic communication system: the optical transmitter, fiber medium and optical receiver.

What it was like to be an Apache&nbsp;fighter-in-training, why Indians as well as whites feared Geronimo, how Geronimo maintained his freedom, and why he finally surrendered&#x2014;the answers to these questions and many more fill the pages of this irresistable volume.</p></p><p><p>A conversation with Robert M. Utley</p><p>Q: Why Geronimo?</p><p>A: Geronimo is the best-known North American Indian of all time. His name continues to resonate with the public even though he was a lesser leader than most other Indian leaders. A major biography has not appeared since 1976, and I wanted to do for Geronimo what I did for Sitting Bull: discover the real person within his own culture.</p><p>Q: How does this compare to your biography of Sitting Bull, <i>The Lance and the Shield</i>?</p><p>A: Sitting Bull was less challenging because of ample documentation, and I believe the real person does emerge. It remains my best of sixteen books unless eclipsed by <i>Geronimo</i>. I think I captured the real Geronimo, but the public will decide.</p><p>Q: What made Geronimo tick?</p><p>A: Many influences made Geronimo tick, not least his culture, which was not only spiritual but also centered on a raid-and-war lifestyle. In the latter he strove to become the greatest but never succeeded. After Geronimo surrendered and spent twenty-three years as a prisoner of war, other influences made him tick into a different person&#x2014;a celebrity in the white man&#x2019;s world. In this he excelled.</p><p>Q: What was the most moving thing you learned in researching Geronimo&#x2019;s life?</p><p>A: The most moving, or surprising, revelation was that in Geronimo&#x2019;s last two years of freedom, his mastery of Mexican geography allowed him to elude his pursuers so constantly that his greatest achievement in war was in avoiding war.</p><p>Praise for Robert M. Utley&#x2019;s <i>The Lance and the Shield</i>:</p><p>"Gripping. . . .

The ability to fabricate tens of millions of individual components on a silicon chip with an area of a few cm2 has enabled the information age. </p> <p> Basic discoveries and inventions between 1945 and 1970 laid the foundations for these chips. In the past 30 years, chip complexity has increased at an exponential rate, primarily because of the constant shrinking of device geometries, improved manufacturing practice, and clever inventions enabling specific functions to be implemented in new ways. Shrinking geometries permit more devices to be placed in a given area of silicon; improved manufacturing permits larger chips to be economically fabricated; and clever inventions permit functions to be realized in smaller areas. It is widely expected that these historical trends will continue for at least another 10-20 years, resulting in chips that contain billions of components. Such chips will have extraordinary capabilities. We will likely find ourselves in 10-20 years thinking of today's chips as primitive precursors to the chips that will be in manufacturing at that time. </p> <p> The technology that is used to build silicon integrated circuits today has evolved largely through empirical methods. It often seems that the chip industry moves so rapidly and new products are introduced so often that there is little time to worry about the scientific basis of the technologies used to build these chips. Yet in parallel with the rapid pace of this industry, a strong effort has been proceeding, often behind the scenes, to develop a solid, physically based understanding of the many technologies used in chip manufacturing. Because of the feature sizes of structures in modern chips, this understanding often needs to be on a molecular or atomic level. It is not sufficient any longer to think of silicon oxidation as simply a chemical reaction between silicon and oxygen that grows SiO2. Today we must understand the detailed bonding between silicon and oxygen atoms and the kinetics that drive this reaction on an atomic basis. </p> <p> Silicon integrated circuit technology makes use of many diverse fields of science and engineering. The optical steppers which print microscopic patterns on wafers, represent one of the most advanced applications of the principles of Fourier optics. Plasma etching involves some of the most complex chemistries used in manufacturing today. Ion implantation draws upon understanding from research in high energy physics. Thin films on the silicon wafer surface exhibit complex mechanical behavior which stretches our understanding of basic materials properties. And of course, silicon devices themselves are approaching physical sizes at which molecular and atomic scale phenomena involving ideas from quantum mechanics are important. One of the great challenges in integrated circuit manufacturing is the need to draw on scientific principles and engineering developments from such an extraordinarily wide range of disciplines. Integrating the knowledge from these diverse disciplines has been and will continue to be a great challenge. Scientists and engineers who work in this field need broad understanding and this ability to seek out, integrate and use ideas from many fields. </p> <p> Over the past 20 years much has been learned about silicon and the other materials that are used in modern chips. Often new knowledge is incorporated in a "model" which may be a mathematical equation describing a process or an atomistic picture of how particular process works. Models codify knowledge and are an elegant way of expressing what is known. They also provide a way of exchanging ideas between researchers in a particular field, and can be tested experimentally to assess their predictive capability. </p> <p> Within the last decade, a serious attempt has been made to develop computer simulation tools which can simulate the various technologies used in fabricating chips. These simulation tools are built around models of the physical processes involved. Some simulation tools today use well-established scientific principles to predict experimental results. Optical lithography simulators, which are based on mathematical descriptions of Fourier optics, are a good example. Such tools today can accurately predict the image that will be printed in resist on a silicon wafer, given a particular mask design and a specific exposure system. Other simulation tools rest on less solid ground. Models of dopant diffusion in silicon, for example, use models which are still debated in the scientific community and which are clearly incomplete in terms of describing all the physical phenomena involved. Nevertheless, even these models are very useful today. </p> <p> This book attempts to describe not only the manufacturing practice associated with the technologies used in silicon chip fabrication, but also the underlying scientific basis for those technologies. Those scientific principles are described in terms of models of the process in many cases. In most chapters, models are discussed in the context of computer simulation programs which have incorporated the models and which use them to simulate technology steps. We make extensive use of simulation examples to illustrate how technologies work and to help in visualizing features of the technologies that are not easily seen any other way. We have found these tools to be powerful teaching aids. </p> <p> Simulation tools are widely used in the semiconductor industry today to supplement traditional experimental methods. While it is unlikely that simulation will completely eliminate the need for experiments, especially in a fast moving industry like the IC industry, simulators can result in very substantial cost savings in developing new generations of technology and in solving manufacturing problems. It is widely believed that simulation tools will be essential in the future if the rapid progress that has characterized the semiconductor industry is to continue. </p> <p> This book is organized somewhat differently than other texts on this general topic, in two principal ways. The first is the extensive use of simulation examples throughout the text. These serve several purposes. The first is simply to help explain the scientific principles involved in each chapter. Simulations help to illustrate things like the time evolution of a growing oxide layer, a diffusing dopant profile or a depositing thin film. They are also very useful in illustrating the effects of specific physical phenomena in a process step because it is straightforward in simulators to add or eliminate specific physical models. Simulators provide the only real way in which complex interactions between process steps can be illustrated and understood. Finally, students who spend their careers in this industry will certainly use these tools and understanding their capabilities and limitations will be important in their future work. </p> <p> The second way in which this book is organized differently is the discussion of a complete process flow early in the book (Chapter 2). While readers new to this field may not appreciate many of the complexities of a CMOS process before studying the later chapters, we have found that an early broad exposure to a complete chip manufacturing process is very helpful in establishing the context for the specific technologies discussed in later chapters. In teaching the material in this book, we usually cover the CMOS process in the first or second lecture somewhat superficially, and then return to the same topic in the last lecture, at which point the details can be more fully discussed. </p> <p> We have also attempted in each chapter to include some discussion of future trends. Predicting the future is obviously difficult and there is some risk that including this material will simply serve to date this book. Nevertheless, we have found that students are often interested in this topic and at least in general terms, we believe it is possible to predict where silicon technology is heading. The semiconductor industry <i>National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors</i> (the NTRS) provides some guidance in looking to the future. </p> <p> The material in this book can be covered in a one quarter senior/graduate level course, although not all of the material in each chapter can be covered in one quarter. A semester long course would provide more time to cover the full range of material in the book. If the book is used in connection with a one quarter long course, one option is to minimize the amount of time spent on the Manufacturing Methods and Measurement Techniques sections in each chapter. A set of lecture notes based on figures from the text is available to instructors by contacting the publisher or the authors by email. We have used these notes several times in a one quarter course at Stanford. </p> <p> Follow-on courses to a basic IC fabrication course can make more extensive use of the simulation tools discussed in this text. We have not used the simulation tools described in this book for homework assignments or for lab assignments in connection with a first course in IC fabrication. We believe that the simulation examples are better used simply as teaching tools in such courses, to illustrate ideas and to clarify physical principles. But in a follow-on course, hands-on experience with these simulation tools is easily possible. Most of the computer tools we use in the book are commercially available and the vendors of these tools are generally anxious to work with university instructors to make the tools available for teaching purposes. </p> <p> Finally, we acknowledge the many students at Stanford who have helped refine the material in this book by using various draft versions of the text in classes we have taught. Their inputs and suggestions have hopefully made this a better book. For many years we have worked with an energetic group of Ph.D. students and faculty colleagues at Stanford who have helped to develop some of the models and software tools described in this book. We particularly acknowledge Professor Bob Dutton and former Ph.D. students Professor Mark Law (now at the U. Florida) and Dr. Conor Rafferty (now at Lucent Technologies). We are also very grateful to a number of individuals who reviewed draft versions of this book and who provided technical inputs to various chapters. Paul Rissman of Hewlett Packard, Jim McVittie of Stanford, and Mark Law all provided substantial inputs and comments. Our own work in this field has been reported over many years by DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) and by the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) . We owe them a considerable debt of gratitude for making our work possible.

So argues Efraim Karsh in this highly provocative book. Rejecting the conventional Western interpretation of Middle Eastern history as an offshoot of global power politics, Karsh contends that the region&#x2019;s experience is the culmination of long-existing indigenous trends, passions, and patterns of behavior, and that foremost among these is Islam&#x2019;s millenarian imperial tradition.<br>The author explores the history of Islam&#x2019;s imperialism and the persistence of the Ottoman imperialist dream that outlasted World War I to haunt Islamic and Middle Eastern politics to the present day. September 11 can be seen as simply the latest expression of this dream, and such attacks have little to do with U.S. international behavior or policy in the Middle East, says Karsh. The House of Islam&#x2019;s war for world mastery is traditional, indeed venerable, and it is a quest that is far from over.</p><p><b>Efraim Karsh</b> is professor and head of the Mediterranean Studies Programme, King&#x2019;s College, University of London.Middle East scholar Karsh surveys for a general audience the region's Islamic political past. Parallel to his narrative, Karsh frequently contrasts the universalistic proclamations of Islam with cycles of imperial consolidation and fragmentation. After recounting the Prophet Muhammad's religio-political establishment of Islam, and the discord about his legacy that continues today, Karsh narrates the battles over Muhammad's caliphate that eventuated in the Umayyad and Abbasid Empires. Karsh's commentary often looks forward to contemporary ideologues of Islam who ransack history to justify grievances. In Karsh's coverage, the irruption of the Crusaders into the Levant hardly provoked a jihad to eject them; that occurred, in his account, through politically ordinary processes of empire building, eventually by the celebrated Saladin. Islamic unity and zeal, however, had always to be affirmed by reestablishers of the caliphate, a theme Karsh incorporates into his chronicling of the rise and decline of the Ottoman Empire, the distribution of its territories after World War I, and varieties of pan-Arabism prevalent after World War II. An informative foundation for further exploration of Islamic history. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense. <p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> has continuously delighted readers, young and old, for more than a century. This classic tale, interpreted by many outstanding artists over the years, is a remarkable story of one little girl who embarks on possibly one of the most amazing adventures in literary history. In this stunning special edition, Helen Oxenbury turns her hand to what is certainly no small project and has succeeded in surpassing expectation. More abundantly illustrated than other editions of the same work, this unabridged version is packed with contemporary and accessible interpretations of the kaleidoscope of characters--the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts--who have each captured the imaginations of generations of children. Alice herself is portrayed as a thoroughly modern miss--casually dressed, personable, and spirited--and her surroundings are brought to effervescent life with a warmth, depth, and distinctive sense of humor that perfectly complement the shenanigans of the topsy-turvy world of Wonderland.

Since that time it has become one of the most critically admired and performed plays in the Western world, a high comedy whose principal theme, the passing of the old semifeudal order, is symbolized in the sale of the cherry orchard owned by Madame Ranevsky.<br>The play also functions as a magnificent showcase for Chekhov's acute observations of his characters' foibles and for quizzical ruminations on the approaching dissolution of the world of the Russian aristocracy and life as it was lived on their great country estates. While the subject and the characters of the work are, in a sense, timeless, the dramatic technique of the play was a Chekhovian innovation. In this and other plays he developed the concept of "indirect action," in which the dramatic action takes place off stage and the significance of the play revolves around the reactions of the characters to those unseen events.<br>Reprinted from a standard edition, this inexpensive well-made volume invites any lover of theater or great literature to enter the world of Madame Ranevsky, Anya, Gayef, Lopakhin, Firs, and the other memorable characters whose hopes, fears, loves, and general humanity are so brilliantly depicted in this landmark of world drama.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>This version of Chekhov&#39;s classic work by playwright Simon Stephens is an anguished and heartbreaking love letter to a society in violent transition.<p>Next to Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov (1860&#x2013;1904) is the most popular playwright in the English-speaking world.

In addition to its fully representative selection of works by Italian and French Renaissance architects, the collection features a fine series of measured drawings derived from still-extant monuments of Greek and Roman antiquity. Since the "Orders" created by the Renaissance builders were based upon the earlier structures, this book provides a means of critical comparison as well as an excellent perspective on the growth and significance of the architectural orders. <br>Eighty black-and-white plates by Augustus Pugin and other distinguished artists depict details of works by such architects as Vitruvius, Palladio, Vignola, Serlio, and Lescot. Featured Greek buildings include the Parthenon, the&nbsp;temples of Apollo and Jupiter, the Portico of Augustus, the Aqueduct of Hadrian, and others.

While social theorists challenged orthodox ways of thinking about the establishment of a "good society," scientists offered up new visions of the workings of the universe. Women fought for increased power within the altered social landscape, and change and controversy reigned in the worlds of art and culture. The chaos of world politics ushered in the two great wars, which would forever alter Europe's position in the world. <br> <em>Europe, 1890-1945</em> offers a concise, accessible overview of this tumultuous time period. It provides a clear outline of the political events that shaped the age and offers a discussion of the seismic shifts in social and cultural landscapes. Topics covered include the rise of modernism in the arts, Social Darwinism and its effects on theories of race, the making of "national" identities, the origins of the modern ecology movement, and the changing roles of women in an era of war and violence. The authors thoroughly analyze the causes and effects of the two great wars, while reaching beyond Europe to discuss the events in the United States, Africa, and Asia that contributed to the evolving face of world politics.

Riveting! Shocking! Eye Opening! A roadmap to successfully treating cancer and other chronic diseases!</b> As featured on the cover of "Publisher's Weekly" this beautifully written, inspirational and enlightening memoir may be the ultimate victory-over-cancer story. The author's journey from advanced-stage cancer, to near death, to complete healing is destined to become a faith-based BEST SELLER.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the prime of life--as a wife, mother and businesswoman--Paula heard the dreaded words: "It's cancer." Doctors gave her 3 to 6 months to live. Her husband, a former airline pilot instructor who had become the senior pastor of a growing church, became Paula's full-time cancer researcher. The two began discovering everything they could about her fatal disease. They met with doctors and oncologists, talked with cancer patients and their families--tirelessly researching every conventional and alternative cancer treatment available. Mostly they prayed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, they felt God revealed the BODY-SOUL-SPIRIT Approach--which deals with the whole person--treating root causes of disease, not just symptoms. It was this approach that saved Paula's life. Twenty months from initial diagnosis her advanced-stage cancer was gone; without chemotherapy--without radiation--and without drugs. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easy to read--the authors express medical concepts and terminology in words and ideas the layperson can easily understand. You won't find this information discussed in mainstream media, nor talked about in your doctor's office.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare to laugh, cry, hold your breath and shout for joy as you accompany this husband and wife on their incredible journey of faith--where personal struggles collide with biblical insight. Learn how Paula defied medical logic, reversed terminal cancer PERMANENTLY and got her life back.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The American Cancer Society reports that one in two men; one in three women, will get cancer in their lifetime. Every day 4,500 Americans are diagnosed with cancer--and every day 1,590 die of this dreaded disease. Cancer is an epidemic. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After doctors gave me just three to six months to live, my husband and I researched everything we could about cancer. I discovered the Body-Soul-Spirit approach which blends SPIRITUAL TRUTHS with the NATURAL LAWS of health. This approach saved my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my ordeal, I befriended five women who also were diagnosed with cancer. They followed conventional treatments. Sadly, one by one, each died within 24 months. I alone survived--without chemotherapy--without radiation--and without drugs. My advanced-stage cancer was gone. I got my life back. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many call me a cancer survivor. I reject that label. I didn't simply survive cancer--I am cured of cancer. That was seventeen years ago. Cancer no longer scares me--nor do I fear its return. You will understand why by the time you have finished reading this book. Now, told for the first time--here is my story.&nbsp;&nbsp; Beautifully written and enjoyable to read, this compelling book may be the ultimate victory-over-cancer story. In the prime of life--as a wife, mother and businesswoman--Paula heard the dreaded words: It's cancer.

She lives in Chicago and teaches at DePaul University.</p><p>Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton (1832-1895) was born into a prominent family in Baha, California. Her grandfather, Don Jose Manuel Ruiz, was Governor of Baha. In 1849, she married U.S. Army Captain Henry S. Burton. Her husband died in the Civil War, leaving the author with two young children to raise. She spent years fighting legal battles over lands that she and her husband had owned, battling squatters and government officials much like Don Mariano's family in <i>The Squatter and the Don. </i>Ruiz de Burton's literary works included newspaper articles, a theatrical comedy of <i>Don Quixote</i>, and the novel, <i>Who Would Have Thought It?</i>Chapter 1 <br>Squatter Darrell Reviews the Past<br><br>&#x201c;To be guided by good advice, is to profit by the wisdom of others; to be guided by experience, is to profit by wisdom of our own,&#x201d; said Mrs. Darrell to her husband, in her own sweet, winning way, as they sat alone in the sitting room of their Alameda farm house, having their last talk that evening, while she darned his stockings and sewed buttons on his shirts. The children (so-called, though the majority were grown up) had all retired for the night. Mr. and Mrs. Darrell sat up later, having much to talk about, as he would leave next day for Southern California, intending to locate&#x2014;somewhere in a desirable neighborhood&#x2014;a homestead claim.1<br><br>&#x201c;Therefore,&#x201d; continued Mrs. Darrell, seeing that her husband smoked his pipe in silence, adding no observations to her own, &#x201c;let us this time be guided by our own past history, William&#x2014;our experience. In other words, let us be wise, my husband.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;By way of variety, you mean,&#x201d; said he smiling. &#x201c;That is, as far as I am concerned, because I own, frankly, that had I been guided by your advice&#x2014;your wisdom&#x2014;we would be much better off to-day. You have a right to reproach me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not wish to do anything of the kind. I think reproaches seldom do good.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No use in crying over spilt milk, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is not my idea, either. On the contrary, if by &#x2018;milk&#x2019; it is meant all or any earthly good whatever, it is the &#x2018;spilt milk&#x2019; that we should lament. There is no reason to cry for the milk that has not been wasted, the good that is not lost. So let us cry for the spilt milk, by all means, if by doing so we learn how to avoid spilling any more. Let us cry for the spilt milk, and remember how, and where, and when, and why, we spilt it. Much wisdom is learnt through tears, but none by forgetting our lessons.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But how can a man learn when he is born a fool?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only an idiot is, truly speaking, a born fool; a fool to such a degree that he cannot act wisely if he will. It is only when perversity is added to foolishness, that a being&#x2014;not an idiot&#x2014;is utterly a fool. To persist in acting wrongfully, that is the real folly. To reject good counsel, either of one&#x2019;s own good thoughts or the good thoughts of others. But to act foolishly by deciding hastily, by lack of mature reflection, that I should only call a foolish mistake. So, then, if we have been foolish, let us at least utilize our foolishness by drawing from it lessons of wisdom for the future. We cannot conscientiously plead that we are born fools when we see our errors.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Darrell smilingly bowed, and with a voice much softer than his usual stentorian tones, said:<br><br>&#x201c;I understand, little wife, but I fear that my streak of perversity is a broad one, and has solely been the bane of my life; it has a fatality accompanying it. I have often seen the right way to act, and yet I have gone with my eyes wide open to do the wrong thing. And this, too, not meaning to do harm to any one, nor wishing to be malicious or mean. I don&#x2019;t know what power impelled me. But if you will forgive my past wickedness, I&#x2019;ll try to do better.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say that. Don&#x2019;t speak of your wickedness, for real wickedness is perversity. You have acted wrongly at times, when you have misapplied your rights and the rights of others, but you have not intentionally done wrong. You are not perverse; don&#x2019;t say that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In a few days it will be twenty-four years since we crossed the plains with our three babies, in our caravan of four wagons, followed by our fine horses and choice Durham cows. I firmly believed then, that with my fine stock and my good bank account, and broad government lands, free to all Americans, I should have given you a nice home before I was five years older; that I would have saved money and would be getting more to make us rich before I was old. But see, at the end of twenty-four years, where and how do I find myself? I am still poor, all I have earned is the name of &#x2018;Squatter.&#x2019;2 That pretty name (which I hate because you despise it) is what I have earned.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say that either, William. We will only recommence one of numerous fruitless discussions. We are not poor, because we have enough to live in comfort, and I do not despise the name of Squatter, for it is harmless enough, but I do certainly disapprove of acts done by men because they are squatters, or to become squatters. They have caused much trouble to people who never harmed them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They, too, the poor squatters, have suffered as much distress as they have caused, the poor hard-worked toilers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is very true, but I am afraid I shall never be able to see the necessity of any one being a squatter in this blessed country of plentiful broad acres, which a most liberal government gives away for the asking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly it. We aren&#x2019;t squatters. We are &#x2018;settlers.&#x2019; We take up land that belongs to us, American citizens, by paying the government price for it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whenever you take up government land, yes, you are &#x2018;settlers,&#x2019; but not when you locate claims on land belonging to any one else. In that case, you must accept the epithet of &#x2018;Squatter.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Darrell set his teeth so tightly, that he bit a little chip off his pipe. Mrs. Darrell went on as if she had not observed her husband&#x2019;s flash of irritation.<br><br>&#x201c;But I hope we will never more deserve such name; I trust that before you locate any homestead claim in Southern California, you will first inform yourself, very carefully, whether any one has a previous claim. And more specially, I beg of you, do not go on a Mexican grant3 unless you buy the land from the owner. This I beg of you specially, and must insist upon it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And how am I to know who is the owner of a rancho4 that has been rejected, for instance?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If the rancho is still in litigation, don&#x2019;t buy land in it, or if you do, buy title from the original grantee, on fair conditions and clear understanding.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know whether that can be done in the Alamar rancho, which I am going to see, and I know it has been rejected. But of one thing you can rest assured, that I shall not forget our sad experience in Napa and Sonoma valleys,5 where&#x2014;after years of hard toil&#x2014;I had to abandon our home and lose the earnings of years and years of hard work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is all I ask, William. To remember our experience in Napa and Sonoma. To remember, also, that we are no longer young. We cannot afford to throw away another twenty years of our life; and really and truly, if you again go into a Mexican grant, William, I shall not follow you there willingly. Do not expect it of me; I shall only go if you compel me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Compel you!&#x201d; he exclaimed, laughing. &#x201c;Compel you, when you know I have obeyed you all my life.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh! no, William, not all your life, for you were well grown before I ever saw you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean ever since I went to Washington6 with my mind made up to jump off the train coming back, if you didn&#x2019;t agree to come North to be my commandant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I have been a very strict disciplinarian,&#x201d; she said, smiling. &#x201c;I think the subaltern has had pretty much his own way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, when he thinks he might. But when the commandant pulls the string, by looking sad or offended, then good-by to the spirit and independence of the subaltern.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One thing I must not forget to ask you;&#x201d; she said, going back to the point of their digression, &#x201c;and it is, not to believe what those men have been telling you about the Alamar rancho having been finally rejected. You know John Gasbang could never speak the truth, and years have not made him more reliable. As for Miller, Hughes and Mathews, they are dishonest enough, and though not so brazen as Gasbang, they will misrepresent facts to induce you to go with them, for they want you with them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know they do; I see through all that: But I see, too, that San Diego is sure to have a railroad direct to the Eastern States.7 Lands will increase in value immediately; so I think, myself, I had better take time by the forelock and get a good lot of land in the Alamar grant, which is quite near town.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But, are you sure it is finally rejected?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I saw the book, where the fact is recorded. Isn&#x2019;t that enough?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, if there has been no error.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Always the same cautious Mary Moreneau, who tortured me with her doubts and would not have me until Father White took compassion on me,&#x201d; said he, smiling, looking at her fondly, for his thoughts reverted back to those days when Miss Mary was afraid to marry him; but, after all, he won her and brought her all the way from Washington to his New England home.<br><br>William Darrell was already a well-to-do young farmer in those days, a bachelor twenty-eight to thirty years of age, sole heir to a flourishing New England farm, and with a good account in a Boston bank, when Miss Mary Moreneau came to New England from Washington to visit her aunt, Mrs. Newton. As Mrs. Newton&#x2019;s husband was William Darrell&#x2019;s uncle, nothing was more natural than for Mary to meet him at his uncle&#x2019;s house. Nobody expected that William would fall in love with her, as he seemed to be proof against Cupid&#x2019;s darts. The marriageable maidens of William&#x2019;s neighborhood had in vain tried to attract the obdurate young farmer, who seemed to enjoy no other society than that of his uncle Newton and his wife.<br><br>But Mary came and William surrendered at once. She, however, gave him no encouragement. Her coldness seemed only to inflame his love the more, until Miss Moreneau thought it was best to shorten her visit and return home about the middle of September.<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you to return home so early?&#x201d; Darrell asked Mary, after Mrs. Newton had informed him of Mary&#x2019;s intention of going.<br><br>&#x201c;Because I think it is best,&#x201d; she answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Why is it best?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For several reasons.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;May I be permitted to ask what are those reasons?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly. One reason is, that as I came to see my aunt and at the same time to rest and improve my health, and all those objects have been accomplished, I might as well go home. Then, my other aunt, with whom I reside, is not feeling well. She went to spend the summer in Virginia, but writes that her health has not improved much, and she will soon come back to Washington. Then some of my pupils will want to recommence their lessons soon, and I want to have some little time to myself before I begin to work. You know, Mr. Darrell, I teach to support myself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, only because you have a notion to do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A notion! Do you think I am rich?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but there is no need of your working.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is a need to me to feel independent. I don&#x2019;t want to be supported by my aunts, while I know how to earn my own living.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Mary, please, I beg of you, let me have the happiness of taking care of you. Be my wife, I am not a rich man, but I have enough to provide for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Darrell, you surprise me. I thank you for the compliment you pay me with your honorable offer, but I have no wish to get married.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you reject me, Miss Mary? Tell me one thing; tell me truly, do you care for any one else?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I care for nobody. I don&#x2019;t want to marry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you will marry some time. If you knew how very miserable you make me, I think you would not have the heart to refuse me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You will get over it. I am going soon. Forget me.&#x201d;<br><br>Darrell made no answer. He staggered out of the room and did not return until the following week, when Mary had left for Washington, accompanied by Letitia, her colored servant (called Tisha), who was devotedly attached to her.<br><br>Darrell had become rather taciturn and less sociable than ever, Mrs. Newton noticed, and since Mary left he seemed to lose flesh and all his spirits, and passed the winter as if life were a burden to him. But when spring came, he brightened up a little, though he felt far from happy. About that time Mrs. Newton had a letter from Mary, saying that she was going to spend vacation in Maryland with her other aunt, and Tisha for her escort.<br><br>&#x201c;She don&#x2019;t come here, because she fears I shall pester her life with my visits. As she knows I can&#x2019;t keep away from her, she keeps away from you. She hates me. I suppose you, too, will take to hating me, by and by,&#x201d; said Darrell, when he heard that Mary was not coming that summer.<br><br>&#x201c;No danger of that, William,&#x201d; Mrs. Newton replied.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, there is. You ought to hate me for driving her away. I hate myself worse than I hate the devil.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;William, you mustn&#x2019;t feel so. It isn&#x2019;t right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know it. But when did I ever do anything right, I&#x2019;d like to know? I wish I could hate her as I hate myself, or as she hates me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;William, she does not hate you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know she don&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p><h2>American Social Welfare Policy: A Pluralist Approach (7th Edition)</h2><p><p> <i> <b>Current social welfare policy in the United States.</b> </i> </p> <p> <b>&nbsp;</b> </p> <p>Taking a policy analysis framework, <i>American Social Welfare Policy: A Pluralist Approach</i>, <i>7/e</i> is the most comprehensive and up-to-date textbook on the American welfare policy.

First published in 1929, <i>The Metropolis of Tomorrow</i> was the ?quintessential document of the prosperity of the 1920s, as well as a ?personal manifesto of visionary urbanism. In it, Ferriss drew and ?discussed the American skyscraper and presented his romantic vision for ?an ideal city of the future.?<p>?This fascimile edition of this classic captures all the drama of the ?original volume, reprinting over 60 of Ferris's striking chiaroscuro ?renderings and his written commentary.

Its flaws are numerous, but oddly endearing&#39;.</p><p>What was a nice Eton boy like Eric Blair doing in scummy slums instead of being upwardly mobile at Oxford or Cambridge? Living <i>Down and Out in Paris and London</i>, repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T.S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort. <p> In Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced "Hotel X," in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met "eccentric people--people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent." Though Orwell's tone is that of an outraged reformer, it's surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.</p><p> In London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in <i>1984</i>. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell's debut remains, as <i>The Nation</i> put it, "the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language." <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Anne of Green Gables (Official Anne of Green Gables, 1)</h2><p><p>"The books I read most as a child were Lucy Maud Montgomery." &#x2015;Madeleine L'Engle</p><p><strong>A classic for all ages, this official, unabridged edition of <em>Anne of Green Gables </em>features the unforgettable character of Anne Shirley and special memories, exclusively from L.M. Montgomery's granddaughter.</strong></p><p>Redheaded orphan Anne Shirley longs for a real home, somewhere she can truly belong. When she first arrives at the Green Gables house on Prince Edward Island, it's everything she ever imagined. But to stay, she'll first have to convince Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert to adopt her. And that means controlling her temper (even when Gilbert Blythe calls her "Carrots"), staying out of trouble (and away from hair dye), and not getting too carried away with her daydreams (though she would make the perfect Lady of Shallot floating down the river). Anne might not always get it quite right, but she does keep things interesting...</p><p>Through Anne's eyes, the ordinary world becomes magical and every day is an adventure. She inspires the dreamer in all of us, never hesitates to say the things we wish we could get away with, and makes us cherish every kindred spirit we meet. It's no surprise Anne is loved around the world by generations of readers.</p></p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

An award-winning teacher with over twenty years of experience answers this question by offering an enlightening and entertaining behind-the-scenes view of a typical semester in his American history course. The unique result&#x2014;part diary, part sustained reflection&#x2014;recreates both the unstudied realities and intensely satisfying challenges that teachers encounter in university lecture halls.</p><p>From the initial selection of reading materials through the assignment of final grades to each student, Patrick Allitt reports with keen insight and humor on the rewards and frustrations of teaching students who often are unable to draw a distinction between the words "novel" and "book." Readers get to know members of the class, many of whom thrive while others struggle with assignments, plead for better grades, and weep over failures. Although Allitt finds much to admire in today's students, he laments their frequent lack of preparedness&#x2014;students who arrive in his classroom without basic writing skills, unpracticed with reading assignments.</p><p>With sharp wit, a critical eye, and steady sympathy for both educators and students, <i>I'm the Teacher, You're the Student</i> examines issues both large and small, from the ethics of student-teacher relationships to how best to evaluate class participation and grade writing assignments. It offers invaluable guidance to those concerned with the state of higher education today, to young faculty facing the classroom for the first time, and to parents whose children are heading off to college.</p></p><p><b>Patrick Allitt</b> is Professor of U.S. History at Emory University, where he holds the Arthur Blank Chair for Teaching Excellence.

I've been teaching history to undergraduates for more than twenty years and have always loved it. We professors, however, are expected not only to teach but also to write books. The books we write to get tenure and advance our careers are about our disciplines, not about our lives as teachers. It's strange, isn't it, that of the tens of thousands of books produced by academics in recent years, hardly any have been about our actual work? As far as I know, there aren't any about the daily life of a history professor. I mentioned this odd fact to Peter Agree, my friend and editor. "I've often thought about writing an account of one semester's teaching, to record what actually happens in class." He encouraged me to try. I did, and here is the result, based on a history class I taught at Emory University, entitled, "The Making of Modern America: 1877-2000."</p><p>Professors disagree about the proper relationship between teachers and students, about how to lecture, how to lead a seminar, how to teach writing and use writing assignments, how to give and grade exams, how to counsel students, and how to evaluate class participation. I have opinions on all these subjects, and here I'll explain and try to justify them by putting them in the context of an actual college course. In addition to describing what happened with a typical class in a typical semester, I'll throw in some how-to advice and a few "What would you do?" ethical dilemmas based on situations that arose as the weeks went by. A few of these points were debated during the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s but much of the day-to-day activity in class bears little or no relation to that debate's great controversies.</p><p>"I'm the teacher, you're the student." There are all kinds of implications. First, as the teacher, I know more about the subject than the students do, which is why they have come to class in the first place. They want to learn things they do not yet know. As their teacher, I have power over them because part of my job is to evaluate their work and give them grades. Second, some students are more talented than others and some are more hard-working than others, which means that their achievements&#x2014;and their grades&#x2014;will differ. Third, despite the steady temptation to make friends with the students, I have to resist it lest it compromise my judgment and impartiality. Professors and students must not be friends (friends don't give each other grades that have a vital effect on their futures). It's certainly OK to be friendly toward students, and to try to make studying a pleasure, but there must be no special friendship beyond a generalized affability. When you first become a college teacher, you're anxious to be liked and admired by the students, and you tend to approach them with an exaggerated sense of how much you can do for them. As a beginning teacher I had the fantastic delusion that I could literally change all the members of a class for the better, meanwhile creating a miniature ideal community in the classroom. Experience wears away the first few layers of illusion, but the tendency to want students to like you persists.</p><p>I don't mean that the students should dislike you, of course. If they like you, so much the better; it contributes to their wanting to come to class and learn. One thing I always hope to show students is that what at first glance seems dry, technical, and dull is really absorbing, exciting, and entertaining. There are moments when students, like anybody else, can be disappointing. Not most of the time, though; what makes the job such a pleasure is them. Treated well, they respond. Many of our students at Emory, with the right incentives, are captivated by learning things they did not know before, especially when they are presented in an interesting or engaging way. My whole teaching life has convinced me that nothing works better as a classroom technique or gets a better response than simple enthusiasm.</p><p>A book like this can, I hope, give teachers some useful advice, but the way to improve as a teacher is by actually teaching; hypothetical situations or abstract discussions are too different from the real thing. The best you can hope for, short of actually getting down to the job, is to learn a handful of principles, on the one hand, and a handful of useful techniques, on the other. Also, it helps to think of what your own favorite teachers did and to watch the best of your contemporaries at work.</p></p><h2>Meteorology Today: An Introduction to Weather, Climate, and the Environment, 9th Edition</h2><p>METEOROLOGY TODAY, Ninth Edition, is one of the most widely used and authoritative texts for the introductory meteorology course.

After the Dashwoods move to a cottage in Devonshire, Elinor&#39;s sister Marianne is torn between the handsome John Willoughby and the older Colonel Brandon. Meanwhile, Elinor&#39;s romantic hopes with Edward Ferrars are hindered due to his prior engagement. Both Elinor and Marianne strive for love while the circumstances in their lives constantly change.</p><p>Jane Austen was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favorable social standing and economic security. Austen&#x2019;s use of biting irony, along with her realism and social commentary have earned her great and historical importance to critics and scholars.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;Austen's tale of two sisters coping with the trials and tribulations of courtship in Regency England is the latest classic to receive a manga makeover. Upon the death of their father, Marianne, Elinor, and their younger sister and mother inherit nothing, and the primary heir, the girls' older half brother, provides them with merely a minimal income. Both sisters are initially unlucky in love&#x2014;tenderhearted Marianne falls for the dashing but fickle Mr. Willoughby, while rational and stalwart Elinor begins to doubt Edward Ferrars's devotion&#x2014;but all is put to right by the conclusion. King has necessarily condensed the story, and much of Austen's dryly humorous dialogue has ended up on the cutting-room floor. Still, though there's no replacement for the original, this is a wonderful edition to read alongside the classic. Even those unfamiliar with the author will quickly absorb the narrative and appreciate Austen's critiques of the institution of marriage and women's precarious position in society. Tse's artistic choices for bringing to life characters' personalities through visual cues are spot-on, and the illustrator expertly conveys drama through the characters' expressive countenances and the use of shading and imagery. VERDICT For fans of Austen as well as newcomers. Those reading the original for the first time may wish to have this insightful adaptation by their side.&#x2014;Mahnaz Dar, School Library Journal</p><h2>Pillaging the Empire: Piracy in the Americas, 1500-1750 (Latin American Realities)</h2><p>This introductory survey to maritime predation in the Americas from the age of Columbus to the reign of the Spanish king Philip V includes piracy, privateering (state-sponsored sea-robbery), and genuine warfare carried out by professional navies.</p><p>KRIS LANE is Assistant Professor of History, The College of William and Mary, Virginia. He has written widely on piracy and witchcraft in the Americas.paper 0-7656-0257-1 Lane (History/Coll. of William &amp; Mary) offers an overview of the history behind the romances of piracy on the ``Spanish Main.'' Lanes thesis regarding piracy in American waters (his focus here) is that by and large piracy in the Caribbean (and, significantly, in the Pacific as well) had its roots in the response of the rest of Europe to Spanish and Portuguese imperial designs on the New World. The first Caribbean pirates were, in fact, French Huguenots, English ``privateers'' (the latter ostensibly acting on behalf of Queen Elizabeth), and Dutch sea-rovers, staunch Protestants all, who were particularly ill-disposed toward the Catholicism of the Iberian thrones. The best known of thesethe Englishmen John Hawkins and Francis Drakehave earned inflated reputations as scourges of the Spaniards, but the Dutch may have inflicted even more damage on Spanish interests in the New World, as Lane points out in detail. Yet our highly colored picture of the pirates and their crews derived more from the final and briefest cycle of piracy in the New World; in the aftermath of the War of the Spanish Succession, just prior to the beginning of the 18th century, a new breed of buccaneer emerged, anarchic, owing allegiance to no flag but his (and, in isolated cases, her) own, and robbing from Spanish, English, French, or anyone else's shipping without discrimination. The most valuable contribution of this book is to put these most famous marauders into a larger historical context and to point out how brief their reign of seagoing terror really was. How disappointing, then, to discover that our fabled swashbucklers were little more than waterborne bandits who practiced a particularly ruthless form of political expediency. Lane recounts his tale in an amiable if somewhat dry voice, and the resulting book is more interesting than stirring. A useful corrective to the mythology of the pirate, but one wishes it were a little more hearty. (illustrations, maps, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Anatol Lieven, a distinguished writer and political commentator, was a correspondent for the London <i>Times</i> in the former Soviet Union from 1990 to 1996 and was commended for his coverage of the Chechen War by the British Press Association.<br><br>In this major new work of history and analysis, Lieven sets Russia&#x2019;s humiliation at the hands of a tiny group of badly organized guerrillas in a plausible framework for the first time. He offers both a riveting eyewitness account of the war itself and a sophisticated and multifaceted explanation for the Russian defeat. Highlighting the numerous ways in which Russian society and culture differ today from the simplistic stereotypes still current in much of Western analysis, he explores the reasons for the current weakness of Russian nationalism both within the country and among the Russian diaspora.<br><br>In the final part of the book Lieven examines the Chechen tradition, providing the first in-depth anthropological portrait in English of this extraordinary fighting people. In his representation of the character of the Chechen nation, Lieven contributes to the continuing debate between "constructivist" and "primordialist" theories of the origins of nationalism and examines the role of both historical experience and religion in the formation of national identity.</p><p>A correspondent for the <i>Financial Time</i>s, Anatol Lieven spent much time in Chechnya, the postage-stamp-sized Caucasus republic whose break from Russia in 1994 precipitated a major war (one that Russia lost). Lieven looks into the long, troubled history of Russian-Chechen relations, noting that each side despised the other for largely cultural reasons (the Chechens have long been involved in organized crime in major Russian cities, whereas Russians have long tried to strip Chechnya of its resources). He notes that Chechen society has historically been militarized (one Armenian said to Lieven, "The men are always fighting and the women are cooking for them, nursing their wounds, and bringing up their children"), making the mountain people a formidable foe. In the meanwhile, writes Lieven, the Russian military suffered from low morale and from corruption of various kinds: Russian field soldiers sold their guns to Chechen guerrillas for vodka and currency, while Russian officers stole their soldiers' pay and Russian politicians skimmed off the top. This is an extraordinary look at a little-known conflict. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>The humiliation of Russia by separatist rebels in the Chechen War marked a key moment in Russian - and perhaps world - history. In this new analysis Anatol Lieven offers a riveting account of the war as a means to explore the painful fate of the post-Soviet state.</p><h2>Basic Methods of Policy Analysis and Planning</h2><p><p>Updated in its 3rd edition, <em>Basic Methods of Policy Analysis and Planning </em>presents quickly applied methods for analyzing and resolving planning and policy issues at state, regional, and urban levels.&nbsp;</p> <p>Divided into two parts, Methods which presents quick methods in nine chapters and is organized around the steps in the policy analysis process, and Cases which presents seven policy cases, ranging in degree of complexity, the text provides readers with the resources they need for effective policy planning and analysis.

John von Neumann, genius, mathematician, and inventor of the nearly ubiquitous computer architecture that bears his name, blazed trails for both camps in <i>The Computer and the Brain</i>. This short book, which was written originally for Yale's Silliman lectures, but published posthumously, summarizes his views on machine and biological intelligence with unprecedented clarity and precision. His understanding of neuroscience was that of a brilliant and strongly motivated amateur at the end of the 1950s--good enough to take on the problem, but by no means matching his comprehension of the machines to which he had devoted much of his professional life. Still, his take on intracranial computation is stunningly prescient--he looks beyond the then-fashionable digital metaphors to suggest a semi-analog strategy that uses parallel processing to make up for its deficiency in speed. Prominent neuroscientific thinkers Paul M. Churchland and Patricia S. Churchland provide a brief, enlightening foreword to this second edition, placing the author's thinking in context and grounding the reader in the scientific milieu that gave rise to <i>The Computer and the Brain</i>. Although his computer architecture slowly is growing obsolete, von Neumann has given us a more lasting legacy in his thinking about thinking. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>At the time of his death in February 1957, John von Neumann, renowned for his theory of games and his work at the Electronic Computer Project at the Institute for Advanced Study, was serving as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission. Paul M. and Patricia S. Churchland are professors of philosophy at the University of California, San Diego.</p><h2>Focus on Russian: An Interactive Approach to Writing and Speaking</h2><p>Providing Russian language students with large amounts of thematically-organized vocabulary, this textbook provides a trouble-shooting approach to Russian grammar.

However, Fanny's childhood is a lonely one as she is never allowed to forget her place. Her only ally is her cousin Edmund. When her cousins befriend two glamorous new young people who have arrived in the area, Henry and Mary Crawford, Edmund starts to grow close to Mary and Fanny finds herself dealing with feelings she has never experienced before.</p></p><p>Though Jane Austen was writing at a time when Gothic potboilers such as Ann Ward Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i> and Horace Walpole's <i>The Castle of Otranto</i> were all the rage, she never got carried away by romance in her own novels. In Austen's ordered world, the passions that ruled Gothic fiction would be horridly out of place; marriage was, first and foremost, a contract, the bedrock of polite society. Certain rules applied to who was eligible and who was not, how one courted and married and what one expected afterwards. To flout these rules was to tear at the basic fabric of society, and the consequences could be terrible. Each of the six novels she completed in her lifetime are, in effect, comic cautionary tales that end happily for those characters who play by the rules and badly for those who don't. In <i>Mansfield Park</i>, for example, Austen gives us Fanny Price, a poor young woman who has grown up in her wealthy relatives' household without ever being accepted as an equal. The only one who has truly been kind to Fanny is Edmund Bertram, the younger of the family's two sons. <p> Into this Cinderella existence comes Henry Crawford and his sister, Mary, who are visiting relatives in the neighborhood. Soon Mansfield Park is given over to all kinds of gaiety, including a daring interlude spent dabbling in theatricals. Young Edmund is smitten with Mary, and Henry Crawford woos Fanny. Yet these two charming, gifted, and attractive siblings gradually reveal themselves to be lacking in one essential Austenian quality: principle. Without good principles to temper passion, the results can be disastrous, and indeed, <i>Mansfield Park</i> is rife with adultery, betrayal, social ruin, and ruptured friendships. But this <i>is</i> a comedy, after all, so there is also a requisite happy ending and plenty of Austen's patented gentle satire along the way. Describing the switch in Edmund's affections from Mary to Fanny, she writes: "I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that everyone may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people." What does <i>not</i> vary is the pleasure with which new generations come to Jane Austen. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>In recent years, Mansfield Park has come to be regarded as Austen&#39;s most controversial novel. It was published in two editions in her lifetime and here the differences between the first edition and the second, including some important amendments made by Jane Austen herself, are clearly noted on the page. The volume provides comprehensive notes, an extensive critical introduction covering the context and publication history of the work, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual appa ratus. This edition is indispensable for all serious scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>Dinner with Churchill: Policy-Making at the Dinner Table</h2><p><p><strong>A colorful and eloquent look at Churchill as he has never been seen before.

The Cuban-born American sculptor is celebrated for her earth-body works of the 1970s, sculptural interventions in the landscape that placed her body--or its haunting silhouette--in symbiotic relationship with nature. Using extracts from her films, original slide documentation, photography, and other archival material, this catalogue illustrates early performances from Mendieta's student days, as well as her more well-known <i>Silueta Series</i> made in Iowa and Mexico from 1973 to 1980. Earth-body works executed in Canada, Cuba and the United States in the early 1980s, and select sculptures, drawings and installations dating to the mid-80s will also be illustrated. This publication promises to be the definitive study of the artist's work.</p><p></p><h2>Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals, Volume II</h2><p>Success in your calculus course starts here!

He's navigated complex situations that range from handling Russian spies to navigating the internal politics at the Bureau. Through that experience, he was forced to develop a knack for reading people--their intentions, their capabilities, their desires and their fears.<br><br>Dreeke's first book, <i>It's Not All About "Me,"</i> has become a cult favorite with readers seeking to build quick rapport with others. His last book, <i>The Code of Trust</i>, was about how to inspire trust in others as a leader. In <i>Sizing People Up</i>, Dreeke shares his simple, six-step system that helps you predict anyone's future behavior based on their words, goals, patterns of action, and the situation at hand.<br><br>Predicting the behavior of others is an urgent need for anyone whose work involves relationships with others, whether it's leading an organization, collaborating with a teammate, or closing a sale. But predictability is not as simple as good and evil, or truth and fiction. Allies might make a promise with every intention of keeping it, not realizing that they will be unable to do so due to some personal shortcoming. And those seeking to thwart your endeavor may not realize how reliable their malevolent tells have become.<br><br>Dreeke's system is simple, but powerful. For instance, a colleague might have a strong moral code, but do they believe your relationship will be long-term? Even the most upstanding person can betray your trust if they don't see themselves tied to you or your desired result in the long term. How can you determine whether someone has both the skill and will to do what they've said they're going to do? Behaviors as subtle as how they take notes will reveal their reliability.<br><br>Using this book as their manual, readers will be able to quickly and easily determine who they can trust and who they can't; who is likely to deliver on promises and who will disappoint; and when a person is vested in your success vs when they are actively plotting your demise. With this knowledge they can confidently embark on anything from a business venture to a romantic relationship to a covert operation without the stress of the unknown.</p><p>Robin Dreeke entered federal law enforcement in 1997, after graduating from the US Naval Academy and serving in the US Marine Corps.

This part of the Camino winds its way along the coast, passing through medieval villages on its way west. In the distance I can see the town of Comillas with its ancient yellow-gray stone buildings, their fa�ades punctuated with vibrant splashes of red from the geraniums in their window boxes.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a blustery day in May of 2013, and white clouds dance across the sky, playing hide-and-seek with the sun. The Cantabrian Sea stretches out in front of me, slate blue topped with little whitecaps; it crashes against the shore below my feet and sprays my face with a delicate, salty mist. The sun breaks through for a moment, and the water becomes a translucent turquoise window, giving me a glimpse of the rocks and white sand beneath the waves.<br> <br>Two people stride toward me, walking sticks swinging purposefully, their backs slightly bent under the weight of their backpacks. A white scallop shell&#x2014;the symbol of their sacred quest&#x2014;hangs from each of their packs, marking them as pilgrims. For over a millennium people have made this spiritual journey to visit what many believe is the final resting place in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, of Saint James from the New Testament.<br> <br>But I am here on a different kind of pilgrimage. I&#x2019;m with my husband and project photographer, Dillon, and we have just met up with Gustavo Sanz Palomera, an archaeologist with the Cantabrian government. We are here to explore a cave in the hillside behind us that is supposed to contain Ice Age paintings.<br> <br>Long before this country was called Spain, people lived in this land. They survived the challenges of an Ice Age world in the relative stability of this region. With its protected river valleys and abundant marine resources, this landscape provided ancient humans with a suitable environment in which to live and thrive. They first settled here over 40,000 years ago and occupied this territory almost continuously until the end of the Ice Age, 30,000 years later.<br> <br>We know they were here from the evidence they left behind: habitation sites scattered with stone tools and animal bones; human burials including &#x201c;grave goods&#x201d; and personal ornaments; and then, of course, there are the caves throughout this region that they decorated with the engravings and paintings that are, in many ways, their greatest legacy.<br> <br>Art presents us with a window into the minds of these people that other types of artifacts just can&#x2019;t provide. It offers us glimpses into their world, their culture, and their belief systems; intriguing hints about their level of sophistication in thinking in the abstract and manipulating symbols; and insight into how far along they may have been in the development of graphic communication. While all of the art has this potential, the geometric imagery in particular seems to indicate a high degree of mastery of many of these uniquely human traits. This category of geometric signs is my passion. Sometimes they accompany the other imagery, and at other times they stand on their own. The signs are what I&#x2019;m here to study.<br> <br>Dillon and I have spent the last month and a half in France documenting the art at eleven different cave sites, so in some ways today&#x2019;s excursion feels almost like &#x201c;another day at the office,&#x201d; albeit a pretty interesting and ever-changing office. We&#x2019;ve worked in massive caves with high, curved ceilings that give us the feeling of being in an underground cathedral; we&#x2019;ve worked in others so narrow in width that photographing the art required contorting ourselves into some very awkward positions; we&#x2019;ve worked in caves with collapsing floors and caves with steep muddy sections that required very careful maneuvering.<br> <br>But as I stand there in my hoodie, jeans, and hiking boots, watching Gustavo pull on a full-body waterproof suit and boots, I start to get the impression that my French caving clothes may not be entirely appropriate for this situation.<br> <br>&#x201c;I really hate this cave,&#x201d; Gustavo tells us as he&#x2019;s getting ready. Dillon and I glance at each other; these are definitely not the words you want to hear before you&#x2019;ve even entered a site&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. especially when your guide is getting seriously geared up!<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so bad about it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Deep mud and very small,&#x201d; Gustavo replies with a grimace. He speaks excellent English but I&#x2019;m hoping in this case that something is being lost in the translation.<br> <br>We turn our backs on the Camino and the sea to face a lush, overgrown green hillside. As we start to hike up a gravel path, I quickly spot the entrance to La Cueva de El Portillo on our left. The entrance doesn&#x2019;t seem too bad: a dark split in the hillside that&#x2019;s about eight feet high, with enough width for us to walk through comfortably. We step over the threshold into a roundish chamber with an even higher ceiling. The chamber is about twenty feet across at its widest point. The floor is pretty muddy, but my hiking boots have seen as much in French caves and survived.<br> <br>Maybe this isn&#x2019;t going to be as bad as I thought.<br> <br>I look around the chamber, my vision adjusting to the gloomy interior. The floor plan I was studying for this cave earlier in the day showed a passageway continuing quite a bit farther into the hillside, but I don&#x2019;t see any exit from the chamber other than the way we came in. Then, as I scan the solid gray walls, my eyes are drawn to a small opening low down on the back wall. It doesn&#x2019;t even quite come up to my knees. Oh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gustavo, is this where we&#x2019;re going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he replies. &#x201c;Much of the cave is like that. This is why I hate it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Huh. I examine the narrow entrance more closely and notice that the passageway angles down sharply, and a small stream of water trickles across the thick muddy surface, its flow splitting to encircle jagged pieces of rock that rise like islands out of the mud as it continues downward into the darkness below. I see no sign of the passage broadening out, either.<br> <br>Dillon cradles his camera bag protectively and gives me a look. Even big, relatively dry caves can do a number on camera equipment, so having to drag his expensive gear through the conditions that El Portillo has to offer is not something he&#x2019;s exactly thrilled about. We also have two battery-powered 500-watt LED banks of light with us, so I guess we&#x2019;re about to find out how rugged everything really is.<br> <br>Gustavo leads the way as he slips the lower half of his body into the tight opening and begins to wriggle downward. As he vanishes into the dark, he tells us, &#x201c;It only goes on like this for about fifteen feet, and then it levels out enough that you can crouch.&#x201d;<br> <br>He calls up to let us know that he&#x2019;s made it down, then flashes his light on the tight walls of the descending passage, giving me a glimpse of what is to come. I&#x2019;m pretty sure I can see a spot about halfway down where it gets even tighter.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s my turn.<br> <br>I grab hold of a protruding lip of rock above the hole and swing my legs into the opening. My feet search around until I find a rock to brace myself on&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not quite vertical, but my angle is much closer to standing than to lying flat. Slithering down into the dark, the mud squelching underneath me, I now understand why Gustavo is wearing a waterproof outfit.<br> <br>Shimmying down, feeling my way with my feet, I&#x2019;m now completely inside the narrow passage&#x2014;my back&#x2019;s against one wall and my face is about six inches from the other. The only sounds I can hear are my own breathing and the quiet trickling of water. A faint glimmer of light reaches me from the entrance chamber above, but other than that, with my body blocking any light Gustavo might be trying to shine up from below, I find myself in complete darkness.<br> <br>Thank God I&#x2019;m not claustrophobic.<br> <br>I work my way down in small increments by pushing my hands off the rock in front of me. I try not to think too much about the weight of stone in the hillside above me. On the upside, at least this region of Spain is not very seismically active.<br> <br>This type of adventure is a regular part of my job. Moments like this one remind me how lucky I really am. As a paleoanthropologist studying some of the oldest art in the world to better understand why our distant ancestors started to create paintings and engravings in Europe, I have explored many caves just like El Portillo&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though not often so muddy or so narrow. Still, I love what I do.<br> <br>After a couple of minutes, I feel a pair of hands grab my feet and guide them onto the cave floor. I turn myself around inside the narrow passageway so I&#x2019;m looking up. We still need to get our gear down safely. Dillon leans in headfirst, and I boost myself back up until we are within reach of each other to receive the two light banks and a camera bag.<br> <br>Finally, it&#x2019;s Dillon&#x2019;s turn to descend. With his greater height and previous experience climbing mountains, he manages the descent much more smoothly than me and emerges onto the cave floor almost doing the limbo as he slides his lower half out and to the side to get around the bulge of rock at the mouth of the passage. We have arrived on the main level of El Portillo.<br> <br>We get to work looking for the geometric signs that are shown on the one and only map that exists for this cave. As with the other rock art sites, there is very little information about El Portillo beyond a one-page description from an independent archaeologist forty years ago and the map I hold in my hand. No one has been back to study this site since 1979, when the archaeologist reported that there was Ice Age art here and made a quick sketch of the cave&#x2019;s floor plan with the locations of images marked simply as &#x201c;grabados&#x201d; (engravings) and &#x201c;restos de figuras&#x201d; (the rest of the images). His written description of what he found was not much more detailed: one, possibly two, red dots; a crumbling engraving of a quadruped, species unknown; other unidentifiable engravings; several red marks; and the remains of some red signs (no description of their shape). It is the red signs that most interest me. I hope to identify what they are.<br> <br>Gustavo tells us we are the first people to have requested access since that archaeologist&#x2019;s original discovery. As I stand up to my ankles in a mixture of brownish-red mud veiled by a thin film of water, somehow I&#x2019;m not surprised. Only a very small group of scholars studies rock art from the Ice Age, and with so many sites to choose from, a site like El Portillo, where only a handful of badly degraded images have been reported, is not likely to be at the top of most of their lists.<br> <br>But I am interested in all the signs at all the Ice Age sites in Europe. At many of them these mysterious geometric signs outnumber the images of the animals and humans by a ratio of at least two to one. I built a database specifically to study these markings and record the contents of each site. That database now comprises more than 350 Ice Age sites. I use its information to analyze the movement of signs, ideas, and culture, as well as the potential origins of graphic communication. Knowing that the information I am working with is accurate is crucial if I am to identify patterns, so even a seemingly insignificant site like El Portillo is important.<br> <br>Having redistributed our gear and consulted the map, we start off along the passage that stretches forward into the dark. We can almost stand up straight here, so this part of the cave feels positively palatial, compared to the narrow entrance chute. We&#x2019;re headed for the red paintings that are supposed to be near the back of the cave, with a stop along the way to look for the engravings. I shine my light around as we walk&#x2014;it&#x2019;s surprising how often I find new signs this way. Not this time, though. The interior rock of El Portillo is a yellowy-brown color, with a heavy buildup of dirt and a smearing of mud across large sections of the passage. This is definitely not the prettiest cave I&#x2019;ve ever been in, and as far as we can tell from the geology, it looked pretty much the same during the Ice Age when those early artists ventured in.<br> <br>We walk along in single file, our boots making sucking sounds in the mud. The sounds echo off the walls, and I notice that the ceiling is starting to get low again. Of course. Gustavo was here only one other time prior to today, as part of his orientation, and apparently El Portillo was just as unpleasant that time around. On that occasion they were unable to find any imagery other than the dots, and the map wasn&#x2019;t even terribly accurate about the cave&#x2019;s layout. With those words of encouragement, and the ceiling sloping sharply toward the floor in front of us, it was time to lie back down in the mud.<br> <br>We scoured the walls for the engravings and other mysterious red signs, using all the tricks at our disposal, but we were only able to find the two red dots. In all likelihood, the other images were never there in the first place. Sometimes natural cracks in the rock or different-colored mineral pockets can masquerade as images, especially in low light, and that could be what the first archaeologist saw. Most of the time I am adding to the inventories, not subtracting, so this was actually a fairly unusual situation for us. Dillon and I have found new signs, or rediscovered missing ones (i.e., they&#x2019;d initially been identified but no one had found them since), at over 75 percent of the sites we have visited. Some of these discoveries have been thrilling and surprising, but El Portillo did not challenge our existing knowledge.<br> <br>I contemplate all of this as I am lying flat on my back in the mud once again, my nose almost scraping the low ceiling, on our way back from photographing the dots, which were located in a very small side chamber. I dig my heels in to get traction and inch my way forward using my fingers to grasp at little outcroppings above my head. After this, we have only to navigate the vertical passageway back to the upper level and we will be out.<br> <br>When we emerge into the sunlight, Dillon and I are both so encrusted with mud that we can&#x2019;t help but laugh. Gustavo is apologetic that we have just spent almost three hours sliding through mud for the sake of a couple of red dots, but I assure him it was time well spent, since confirming the contents of these Ice Age sites is precisely why I am here. When doing research, even negative results are important. Now I can update my database.<br> <br>The two dots were quite interesting in their own way. Rather than being painted in the typical red or black colors we usually see at sites across Spain and elsewhere in Europe, these were made using a distinct shade of mineral iron oxide (ochre) pigment that was much closer to pink than to red. This particular color seems to have become quite popular during the later millennia of the Ice Age in the region&#x2014;maybe pink was the new red?&#x2014;and it ties El Portillo in to the larger body of art in Cantabria. I often wonder what compelled these people to make this hazardous and rather soggy journey underground, with only the aid of a torch or oil lamp. What was it about this cave that made it worth it, especially if they did little more than paint two red dots?1<br> <br>These are the kinds of questions that kept me crawling through the mud in passageways deep under the earth over the two-year span of this project. And, luckily, not every site was as devoid of symbols as El Portillo...</p><h2>Progress in Mathematics, Grade 5 Student Workbook, 9780821582251, 0821582259</h2><p>Great condition.

The story is told in the first person by young Jim Hawkins, whose mother keeps the Admiral Benbow Inn. An old seadog, a resident at the inn, hires Jim to keep a watch out for other sailors whom he fears but, despite all precautions, the old man is served with the black spot which means death. Among the dead man's belongings Jim discovers a map showing the location of the buried treasure of the notorious pirate Captain Flint. It is not long before he, along with Doctor Livesey and Squire Trelawney, sets sail to find the treasure. However, amongst the hired hands is the one-legged Long John Silver who has designs on the treasure for himself.<p>The continuing fascination with this tale of high drama, buried treasure and treachery bears out what Stevenson wrote about the book to his friend W.

Rhea completes his much-lauded history of the Overland Campaign, a series of Civil War battles fought between Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee in southeastern Virginia in the spring of 1864. Having previously covered the campaign in his magisterial volumes on <i>The Battle of the Wilderness</i>, <i>The Battles for Spotsylvania Court House and the Road to Yellow Tavern</i>, <i>To the North Anna River</i>, and <i>Cold Harbor</i>, Rhea ends this series with a comprehensive account of the last twelve days of the campaign, which concluded with the beginning of the siege of Petersburg.</p><p><i>On to Petersburg</i> follows the Union army&#x2019;s movement to the James River, the military response from the Confederates, and the initial assault on Petersburg, which Rhea suggests marked the true end of the Overland Campaign. Beginning his account in the immediate aftermath of Grant&#x2019;s three-day attack on Confederate troops at Cold Harbor, Rhea argues that the Union general&#x2019;s primary goal was not&#x2015;as often supposed&#x2015;to take Richmond, but rather to destroy Lee&#x2019;s army by closing off its retreat routes and disrupting its supply chains. While Grant struggled at times to communicate strategic objectives to his subordinates and to adapt his army to a faster-paced, more flexible style of warfare, Rhea suggests that the general successfully shifted the military landscape in the Union&#x2019;s favor.</p><p>On the rebel side, Lee and his staff predicted rightly that Grant would attempt to cross the James River and lay siege to the Army of Northern Virginia while simultaneously targeting Confederate supply lines. Rhea examines how Lee, facing a better-provisioned army whose troops outnumbered Lee&#x2019;s two to one, consistently fought the Union army to an impasse, employing risky, innovative field tactics to counter Grant&#x2019;s forces. </p><p>Like the four volumes that preceded it, <i>On to Petersburg</i> represents decades of research and scholarship and will stand as the most authoritative history of the final battles in the campaign.</p></p><p>Gordon C. Rhea is the author of <i>The Battle of the Wilderness, May 5&#x2013;6, 1864</i>, winner of the Civil War Regiments Book Award; <i>The Battles for Spotsylvania Court House and the Road to Yellow Tavern, May 7&#x2013;12, 1864</i>; and <i>Cold Harbor: Grant and Lee, May 26&#x2013;June 3, 1864</i>, winner of the Austin Civil War Round Table&#x2019;s Laney Prize.In this fifth and final volume of his magisterial study of Grant&#x2019;s Overland Campaign from the Wilderness to Petersburg, Gordon Rhea maintains the high standard of the preceding volumes. He shows in clear and engrossing detail how the brilliant stroke of the Army of the Potomac&#x2019;s disengagement from Cold Harbor failed in the end to capture Petersburg, thereby prolonging the war and its crushing casualties another ten months. (James M. McPherson, author of The War That Forged a Nation: Why the Civil War Still Matters)<br><br><i>On to Petersburg</i> brings to a triumphant close Gordon Rhea&#x2019;s authoritative treatment of the Overland campaign between Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee. Marked by the impeccable scholarship, descriptive grace, and analytical acuity of the previous four volumes, it illustrates the rich possibilities when a gifted historian engages with an important and dramatic topic. (Gary W. Gallagher, author of The Union War)<br><br>Gordon Rhea&#x2019;s <i>On to Petersburg</i> maintains the high standards so widely praised in his previous four volumes on the Overland Campaign. Rhea has established himself as the undisputed authority on the momentous struggle between Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant in May and June of 1864, and the deep research, lucid analysis, and engaging writing of this last volume in his series only enhances that reputation. (A.

Now a distinguished scholar offers the first comprehensive account of the evolutionary origins of art and storytelling. Brian Boyd explains why we tell stories, how our minds are shaped to understand them, and what difference an evolutionary understanding of human nature makes to stories we love. </p><p>Art is a specifically human adaptation, Boyd argues. It offers tangible advantages for human survival, and it derives from play, itself an adaptation widespread among more intelligent animals. More particularly, our fondness for storytelling has sharpened social cognition, encouraged cooperation, and fostered creativity.</p><p>After considering art as adaptation, Boyd examines Homer&#x2019;s <i>Odyssey</i> and Dr. Seuss&#x2019;s <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i> demonstrating how an evolutionary lens can offer new understanding and appreciation of specific works. What triggers our emotional engagement with these works? What patterns facilitate our responses? The need to hold an audience&#x2019;s attention, Boyd underscores, is the fundamental problem facing all storytellers. Enduring artists arrive at solutions that appeal to cognitive universals: an insight out of step with contemporary criticism, which obscures both the individual and universal. Published for the bicentenary of Darwin&#x2019;s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of <i>Origin of Species,</i> Boyd&#x2019;s study embraces a Darwinian view of human nature and art, and offers a credo for a new humanism.</p></p><p>Brian Boyd, University Distinguished Professor in the Department of English, Drama and Writing Studies, University of Auckland, is the world&#x2019;s foremost authority on the works of Nabokov.&#x201c;This is an insightful, erudite, and thoroughly original work. Aside from illuminating the human love of fiction, it proves that consilience between the humanities and sciences can enrich both fields of knowledge.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steven Pinker, Harvard College Professor, Harvard University, and author of <i>The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Integrating a vast array of findings in the social and biological sciences and in the history of the arts, Boyd makes a compelling case for art as an adaptive human behavior. I can think of no similar work in contemporary literary theory; I have to go back to Northrop Frye's <i>Anatomy of Criticism</i> for a work of comparable imaginative sweep and analytical precision. A monumental achievement.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Bordwell, University of Wisconsin-Madison</b><br><br>&#x201c;Rich, intelligent and incredibly wide-ranging--from Zeus to Seuss, <br>as one chapter title says--this book is indispensable reading for <br>anyone who wants to think about the nature of fiction. Do we imagine that situating art within a theory of evolution must be reductive? Then we must consider, as Boyd suggests we do, the difference between solving a problem and picturing a chance of solving a problem--and imagine what it would be mean not to be able to do the second.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Wood, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>On the Origin of Stories</i> may have an impact far beyond academic circles...No one thinks on this scale anymore. Bent to the cultivation of shrinking plots of expertise, enlivened by the occasional boundary squabble, we are ill-accustomed to broad new theories even from Young Turks, let alone established critics. Ambition is in itself cause for celebration...Boyd's treatment is engrossing, as elegant in the writing as the reasoning. It offers a new insight into the question of why some works [of fiction] speak to audiences across cultures and generations...To look at a story as a naturalist looks at a leaf or a shell, not criticizing improvisations but marveling at its inventive beauty, is a refreshing experience...Whatever your opinion of Derrida, Boyd offers absolution to all lovers of fiction. Our childish taste for make-believe, it seems, is a little more serious than we thought.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Laura Dietz</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Brian Boyd's <i>On the Origin of Stories</i>, which presents itself as a work of "evocriticism," might well be a straw in the wind blowing contemporary criticism back from Culture to Nature. Given the rampant culturalism of much current literary work, which can see the natural only as an ideologically insidious "naturalizing," it is agreeable to read a work which discusses Homer cheek by jowl with allusions to dung beetles, the neocortex and cases of sexual harassment among pigeons. In sober evolutionary spirit, Boyd has no doubt that whatever more glamorous things human beings can get up to, they are in the first place natural material objects. He also insists in the teeth of postmodern orthodoxy that there is indeed a universal human nature; that culture is not unique to the human animal; and that there is a universally identifiable activity known as art. Nobody who is aware of the excesses of contemporary culturalism could doubt the subversive force of these platitudes. The word "natural," like the words "fact" and "truth," hardly ever turns up in such writings without being ceremoniously draped in scare quotes--and this in an ecological age. The point to Boyd's superbly erudite study is to offer an evolutionary theory of art...Brian Boyd has produced a challenging piece of critical theory, which might well herald the return to Nature of which cultural criticism is in such sore need.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Terry Eagleton</b><b>, </b><b><i>London Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Like all the best stories, this one has a pleasing symmetry. It is a book in two parts, each illuminating the other. On one side stands evolutionary theory and its attempts to explain human nature. On the other is story itself, represented by two great works of fiction: Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> and Dr. Seuss's <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i>...[Boyd] has some novel and thought-provoking ideas, and his book covers an impressively wide terrain...What really matters, Boyd makes clear, is whether a story is worthy of our attention. <i>On the Origin of Stories</i> surely is.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Kate Douglas</b><b>, </b><b><i>New Scientist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Boyd's] highly intelligent, impressively learned and patiently elaborated theory of the origin of fiction and the other arts begins with the idea that art is cognitive play...Diffusion of Boyd's ideas might even, in our utilitarian and scientistic society, restore the prestige of the arts and humanities.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Deresiewicz</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating...Elaborate hypotheses like this one are themselves a kind of story, and Boyd tells his on a grand scale. His central arguments are prefaced by a substantial reprise of basic evolutionary theory--very useful if you're unfamiliar with it--and followed by two case studies, of Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> and the tales of Dr. Seuss. It is expert, though highly idiosyncratic, literary criticism..."Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive," Wordsworth wrote of the first, intoxicating years of the French Revolution. Reading [a] path-breaking book like [this], one feels something similar.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>George Scialabba</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a very important book--important in its own right, but also important as a marker for significant change in the academic study of the humanities. Basically, Boyd sees art as an adaptation, one that brings advantages in our struggle for survival and procreative success. He studies the ways in which stories focus attention (as play does) and foster collaboration and unity. This heightened form of play yields a heightened form of sociality, creates 'creativity,' refines and extends our cognitive skills, helps us to understand one another's thoughts, intentions and motives, see our world from multiple perspectives, explore possibilities and not just actualities, command attention, enjoy status and foster reciprocal altruism (among other things).<br>Most interesting, I believe, is the fact that Boyd's position validates thousands of years of humanistic thought, from Aristotle to Horace, Sidney, Johnson, the Kant of the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> (though not perhaps the Kant of the <i>Critique of Judgment</i>) and the successful practice of the storyteller's art by a host of writers whose work has been not only substantive but widely popular. In short, Boyd's study of human nature, human behavior, human development and human artistic expression squares with what many of us have long believed and it does so with the leverage of contemporary, evolutionary science.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard B. Schwartz, University of Missouri, Columbia</b><br><br>&#x201c;Brian Boyd brilliantly makes the case for literature as necessary for the survival of humankind. Step by step, he builds his argument that we have evolved to engage in play and, in particular, in storytelling...Both Homer and Dr. Seuss must catch and hold our attention with their artistry, their universality, and their moral tone. Boyd forcefully and elegantly supports his view that art is not simply pleasurable for humans but crucial to our survival.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Barbara Fisher</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b></p><h2>War and Peace: Volume 1 (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Presents the classical epic of the Napoleonic Wars and their effects on four Russian families, together with critical and textual notes</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Israel&#39;s Divine Healer</h2><p><p>Israel's Diving Healer is the first complete, systematic treatment of the biblical motif of God as "Divine Healer."

Israel's Divine Healer begins with a study of various Hebrew words on healing. It then explores, within the larger context of the Ancient Near Eastern religions, the roles of medicine, magic, and the physician-priest together with their possible influences upon Israel's beliefs and practices regarding healing.

They live near Charlotte, NC.</p>Preface<p>My interest in Israel&#x2019;s divine Healer is long-standing, both spiritually and academically. The origins of that interest, however, are unique and worth recounting. Raised in a Conservative Jewish home on Long Island, New York, I can only explain my teenage foray into the world of drugs and hard rock music as symptomatic of the times&#x2014;those turbulent years of the late 60s and early 70s, the years of Woodstock idealism, the so-called Age of Aquarius. For me, a pleasure-seeking youth of just fifteen or sixteen, the rock/drug world was full of allure and temptation, and I plunged into that world with reckless abandon.</p><p>Little did I know that by the end of 1971, while still sixteen, I would experience a radical conversion in a small Italian Pentecostal church in Queens, New York. Drawn there with the sole purpose of pulling my two best friends (and fellow band members) out of the church and back to "reality," I was confronted instead with the love of God emanating from a sincere people who simply believed. Their testimony of God&#x2019;s life-changing power, their acceptance of this young, proud, stubborn rebel, and their eyewitness stories of miracles, healings, and deliverances seemed totally genuine. Soon enough, my resistance melted, faith came alive, and I surrendered. In a moment of time, I was free.</p><p>In the present context, there are two key events from those early days that are especially relevant. First, I experienced a sudden and dramatic healing of a bad and persistent case of hives, which had tormented me for days. The remission came in immediate answer to prayer after a frustrating week. Now I was an eyewitness. Second, at the behest of my dear father, I met the local rabbi. Pleased beyond words that I had given up my destructive ways, my father wanted me to "return" to my traditions. Although I did not take the route they had envisioned, the relationship formed with that rabbi has endured for almost twenty-five years, and it was in direct response to his persistent prodding that I began to study Hebrew in college. At that time, I had not the faintest inkling that those studies would lead to serious Semitic scholarship.</p><p>But that is only part of the story. Life was not always so simple in my Pentecostal church. Why were many prayers for the sick not answered? Why was it that the more I read and learned, the more I questioned some of our doctrinal distinctives? By 1977, a separation came, and I became active in a church that was theologically and academically much more broad-minded, albeit certainly lacking in terms of those early, miraculous testimonies of which I had by now become skeptical. Then, in 1982&#x2013;83, I and many others in the congregation experienced a dramatic spiritual renewal, prompting me to reconsider the relevance of what was then my working dissertation topic, "Abbreviated Verbal Idioms in the Hebrew Bible." In the light of eternity, was such a project worth the time and effort?</p><p>Along with this was a new problem: People were getting healed again in answer to prayer, but their theology, so far as I could tell, was askew, and their use of Scripture to support their position seemed amiss. The same held true, I thought, in even more pronounced fashion among the leading figures in public healing ministry. How could this be? Was it my view that needed adjustment? Or was God simply honoring honest, trusting hearts in spite of doctrinal error?</p><p>I was determined to understand as best I could the biblical views of God as Healer, and as one specializing in Old Testament and Semitics, the study of the Hebrew root rampam&#x2019; seemed logical. Thus I began my exegetical and comparative philological study of rampam&#x2019;, completed as a New York University dissertation in 1985 under the tutelage of Baruch Levine. At the same time, I began to teach on the subject of healing in various popular and academic settings here and abroad, often praying for the sick as well. I can now add further eyewitness accounts of supernatural answers to prayer, along with some difficult stories of suffering, pain, and death, all in connection with seeking to minister to those in need.</p><p>In 1990, the idea of turning my rather technical (and not particularly edifying) dissertation into a book began to gel, and, at the request of a potential publisher, in 1991 I drafted a chapter on "Israel&#x2019;s Divine Healer in the Prophetic Books," greatly expanding and revising relevant portions of my thesis for a theological and biblical audience. It was to the credit of Len Goss at Zondervan Publishing House that the projected volume was deemed suitable for the nascent series, Studies in Old Testament Biblical Theology. The bulk of this present monograph was written from June 1992 to April 1994, with roughly 20 percent of the material drawn from my thesis. That which was used, of course, has been thoroughly reworked, and I am amazed to see just how much I have learned personally through a fresh, wide-ranging encounter with the biblical text. It is liberating to derive one&#x2019;s theology and beliefs from the Scriptures, without having a prefabricated mold into which every passage and book must be squeezed. The reader can make his or her own judgment as to how faithful I have been to the task of honest interpretation.</p><p>When preparing the chapter on the prophetic literature, I regularly used my own translations of the Hebrew text. This has been retained in what is now chapter 4. However, as the project wore on, I felt that, for the most part, my own renderings added little to the argument, hence my primary use of the NIV elsewhere. When appropriate, I have suggested corrections to the NIV, and for comparison, I have made reference in particular to the New Jewish Version, since its overall approach and methodology often vary greatly from "Christian" versions.</p></p><h2>1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die</h2><p><b>With over 1.75 million copies sold worldwide, this book is a must-have for all movie lovers.</b> This brand-new edition of <i>1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die</i> covers more than a century of movie history.

Abstract and complex ideas are made understandable by the authors' lucid style. Of particular interest is the up-to-date survey of Buddhist Tantra in India, a branch of Buddhism where strictly controlled sexual activity can play a part in the religious path. Williams' discussion of this controversial practice as well as of many other subjects makes <em>Buddhist Thought</em> crucial reading for all interested in Buddhism.</p><p><strong>Paul Williams</strong> is Professor of Indian and Tibetan Philosophy and Co-Director of the Centre for Buddhist Studies at the University of Bristol. His numerous publications include <em>Mahayana Buddhism</em> (Routledge, 1989).<strong>'I would thoroughly recommend this book as an introduction for anyone trying to understand the rich variety of Buddhist thought on the fundamental question of existence.'</strong> - <em>Denise Cush, Bath Spa University College</em><br><br><strong>'Although aimed at students, the book is ideal for the general reader.'</strong> - <em>Network</em><br><br><strong>'The strength of the book is the clarity of its presentation and the quality and breadth of the scholarship behind it ... It will be stimulating reading to anyone a little bewildered by the wealth and variety of Buddhist texts and practices ... It deserves to enter many a reading list.'</strong> - <em>Reviews in Religion and Theology</em></p><h2>The White Scourge: Mexicans, Blacks, and Poor Whites in Texas Cotton Culture (Volume 2) (American Crossroads)</h2><p>In a book that fundamentally challenges our understanding of race in the United States, Neil Foley unravels the complex history of ethnicity in the cotton culture of central Texas. This engrossing narrative, spanning the period from the Civil War through the collapse of tenant farming in the early 1940s, bridges the intellectual chasm between African American and Southern history on one hand and Chicano and Southwestern history on the other. <i>The White Scourge</i> describes a unique borderlands region, where the cultures of the South, West, and Mexico overlap, to provide a deeper understanding of the process of identity formation and to challenge the binary opposition between "black" and "white" that often dominates discussions of American race relations.<br><br>In Texas, which by 1890 had become the nation's leading cotton-producing state, the presence of Mexican sharecroppers and farm workers complicated the black-white dyad that shaped rural labor relations in the South. With the transformation of agrarian society into corporate agribusiness, white racial identity began to fracture along class lines, further complicating categories of identity. Foley explores the "fringe of whiteness," an ethno-racial borderlands comprising Mexicans, African Americans, and poor whites, to trace shifting ideologies and power relations. By showing how many different ethnic groups are defined in relation to "whiteness," Foley redefines white racial identity as not simply a pinnacle of status but the complex racial, social, and economic matrix in which power and privilege are shared.<br><br>Foley skillfully weaves archival material with oral history interviews, providing a richly detailed view of everyday life in the Texas cotton culture. Addressing the ways in which historical categories affect the lives of ordinary people, <i>The White Scourge</i> tells the broader story of racial identity in America; at the same time it paints an evocative picture of a unique American region. This truly multiracial narrative touches on many issues central to our understanding of American history: labor and the role of unions, gender roles and their relation to ethnicity, the demise of agrarian whiteness, and the Mexican-American experience.</p><p>"At a time when the inadequacy of Black-white models for understanding race in the U.S. has become increasingly clear, Foley's work is of special importance for the clarity with which it describes complexity. One key to his success is his consistent emphasis on social structure and class relations as he probes the dynamics of race."&#x2015;David Roediger, author of <i>The Wages of Whiteness</i><br><br>"Foley deftly brings social, cultural, and political history together in a breathtaking, beautifully written narrative."&#x2015;Robin D. G. Kelley, author of <i>Race Rebels</i><b>Neil Foley</b> is the Robert H. and Nancy Dedman Chair in History at Southern Methodist University.</p><h2>Why Social Justice Matters</h2><p>In the past twenty years, social injustice has increased enormously in Britain and the United States, regardless of the party in power. At the same time, the idea of social justice itself has been subverted, as the mantras of personal responsibility and equal opportunity have been employed as an excuse for doing nothing about the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many and for making ever harsher demands on the poor and vulnerable. <br> <p>With grace and wit, Brian Barry exposes the shoddy logic and distortion of reality that underpins this ideology. Once we understand the role of the social structure in limiting options, we have to recognize that really putting into practice ideas such as equal opportunity and personal responsibility would require a fundamental transformation of almost all existing institutions.</p> <p>Barry argues that only if inequalities of wealth and income are kept within a narrow range can equal prospects for education, health and autonomy be realized. He proposes a number of policies to achieve a more equal society and argues that they are economically feasible. But are they politically possible?<br> </p> <p>The apparent stability of the status quo is delusory, he responds: radical changes in our way of life are unavoidable. Whether these changes are for better or for worse depends partly on the availability of a coherent set of principles and a programme flowing from them that is capable of mobilizing the growing discontent with business as usual. That is, ultimately, why social justice matters.</p></p><p><b>Brian Barry</b> is Lieber Professor of Political Philosophy at Columbia University.&#x201c;A brilliant polemic against inequality.&#x201d;<br> <b>Roy Hattersley, <i>The Guardian</i></b> <p>&#x201c;Barry's pugnacious defence of a robust social democracy deserves to find a wide readership ... for disillusioned social democrats, <i>Why Social Justice Matters</i> stands as a refreshingly staunch and intelligent manifesto.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>New Statesman</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Barry's writing is extremely engaging. His arguments are supported by a wide range of examples and illustrations and an impressive breadth of scholarship.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>Ethics and Social Welfare</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;This book is a powerful argument against the utter inequity of the current political and economic system in the UK and against the way in which a discourse of &#x2018;equal opportunities&#x2019; is used to maintain what Barry describes as the &#x2018;machinery of injustice&#x2019;. In this extraordinarily simple and lucid book, Barry weaves striking threads of supporting evidence, anecdotes, quotations and statistics together to encourage us to insist that another (just) world is not only possible but that an unjust world cannot endure.&#x201d;<br> <b><i>British Journal of Sociology</i></b></p> <p>&#x201c;Barry persuasively argues that differentials in positional goods allow the rich to have better personal health due to higher self-esteem, better access to more fulfilling jobs due to a wealth of social connections, and greater ability to capture the government and use it to secure their own interests.&#x201d;<br> <i><b>Utilitas</b></i></p></p><h2>The Oxford Book of Jewish Stories</h2><p>In this remarkably wide-ranging anthology, Ilan Stavans has collected the work of more than fifty notable Jewish writers from around the globe, weaving these diverse viewpoints and voices into a rich portrait of Jewish literary tradition.<br><br><em>The Oxford Book of Jewish Stories</em> takes us from the mid-1800s right up to the present, encompassing the full spectrum of Jewish writing around the world. The variety of tales captured here is stunning. Readers will find stories such as "A Yom Kippur Scandal" by Sholem Aleichem, the father of Yiddish literature; "Before the Law" by Franz Kafka; "Looking for Mr. Green" by Saul Bellow; "The Spinoza of Market Street" by Isaac Bashevis Singer; and "Midrash on Happiness" by Grace Paley. Stavans has included many pieces by Americans, including such markedly different writers as Cynthia Ozick, Bernard Malamud, Moacyr Seliar, Stanley Elkin, Delmore Schwartz, Dan Jacobson, Francine Prose, Allegra Goodman, and Philip Roth. And here too are pieces from around the globe, by writers no less varied: Isaac Babel, Italo Svevo, Primo Levi, Elias Canetti, Amos Oz, and Danilo Kis.

It is primarily intended for students whose research requires more than an introductory statistics course, but who may not have an extensive background in rigorous mathematics. It&#39;s also suitable for courses with students of varying mathematical abilities. Hamilton provides students with a practical, realistic, and graphical approach to regression analysis so that they are better prepared to solve real, sometimes messy problems. For students and professors who prefer a heavier mathematical emphasis, the author has included optional sections throughout the text where the formal, mathematical development of the material is explained in greater detail. REGRESSION WITH GRAPHICS is appropriate for use with any (or no) statistical computer package. However, Hamilton used STAT A in the development of the text due to its ease of application and sophisticated graphics capabilities. (STATA is available in a student package from Duxbury including a tutorial by the same author: Hamilton, STATISTICS WITH STAT A, 5.0, 1998; ISBN: 0-534-31874-6.)</p><p>Ph.D., University of Colorado at Boulder1.

No longer is execution speed the sole criterion for judging compiled code. Today, code might be judged on how small it is, how much power it consumes, how well it compresses, or how many page faults it generates. In this evolving environment, the task of building a successful compiler relies upon the compiler writer's ability to balance and blend algorithms, engineering insights, and careful planning. Today's compiler writer must choose a path through a design space that is filled with diverse alternatives, each with distinct costs, advantages, and complexities. <br><br><i>Engineering a Compiler</i> explores this design space by presenting some of the ways these problems have been solved, and the constraints that made each of those solutions attractive. By understanding the parameters of the problem and their impact on compiler design, the authors hope to convey both the depth of the problems and the breadth of possible solutions. Their goal is to cover a broad enough selection of material to show readers that real tradeoffs exist, and that the impact of those choices can be both subtle and far-reaching. <br><br>Authors Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon convey both the art and the science of compiler construction and show best practice algorithms for the major passes of a compiler.

Dorf, and featuring leading constitutional law scholars &#x2013; provides real lessons pertaining to the interpretation of the United States Constitution. <p>Constitutional Law Stories offers in-depth analysis of leading federal constitutional law cases by providing behind-the-scenes stories, outlining the historical context of each case and defining the role these cases play in framing fundamental questions about American law and government. The latest release from the Foundation Press "Law Stories" series, Constitutional Law Stories centers on 15 pivotal cases, including Roe v. Wade, which upheld a woman&#x2019;s right to choose; Clinton v. Jones, which denied President Clinton temporary immunity from civil litigation, and set the stage for his eventual impeachment; and Korematsu v. United States, which questioned the legality of military orders excluding Japanese-Americans from the West Coast of the United States during World War II. </p><p>The selected cases represent three distinct areas of constitutional law: the structural constitution, which defines separation of powers and federalism; equality and the constitution (equal rights); and the constitution and liberty (individual rights, including First Amendment rights). </p><p>Today&#x2019;s leading constitutional law scholars, including Daniel Farber, University of California, Berkeley; Samuel Issacharoff, Columbia University; and Mark Tushnet, Georgetown University, are among the writers of the essays in Constitutional Law Stories. </p><p>General Editor Paul Caron and the editors of the "Law Stories" series bring landmark cases to life with a behind-the-scenes look at leading cases in important areas of law. Each book examines the parties of the dispute, the legal and historical context, and the immediate impact of the case, as well as the continuing importance of the case in shaping modern law. Other titles in the Law Stories series include Tax Stories, Torts Stories and Property Stories.</p></p><p>Professor of Law, Columbia Law School</p><h2>The Anthropology of Childhood: Cherubs, Chattel, Changelings</h2><p>The raising of children, their role in society, and the degree to which family and community is structured around them, varies quite significantly around the world. The Anthropology of Childhood provides the first comprehensive review of the literature on children from a distinctly anthropological perspective. Bringing together key evidence from cultural anthropology, history, and primate studies, it argues that our common understandings about children are narrowly culture-bound. Whereas dominant society views children as precious, innocent and preternaturally cute &#39;cherubs&#39;, Lancy introduces the reader to societies where children are viewed as unwanted, inconvenient &#39;changelings&#39;, or as desired but pragmatically commoditized &#39;chattels&#39;. Looking in particular at family structure and reproduction, profiles of children&#39;s caretakers, their treatment at different ages, their play, work, schooling, and transition to adulthood, this volume provides a rich, interesting, and original portrait</p><p>Bringing together key evidence from cultural anthropology, history, and primate studies, Lancy introduces the reader to societies where children are viewed as unwanted, inconvenient &#39;changelings&#39;.

Colonization is seen as a mutually beneficial process, in which "civilization&#x201d; was brought to the natives who in return shared their land and cultures. The opposing historical camp views colonization as a form of genocide in which the native populations were passive victims overwhelmed by European military power. In this fresh examination, an activist and historian of native descent argues that the colonial powers met resistance from the indigenous inhabitants and that these confrontations shaped the forms and extent of colonialism. This account encompasses North and South America, the development of nation-states, and the resurgence of indigenous resistance in the post-World War II&nbsp;era. </p></p><p>CA<p>"It would be an amazing thing to make copies of this work and slip into every school in America and slide it into every history book for children to read.

This reader serves as the primary anthology for the Post-1945 U.S. History course, Comprehensive topical coverage includes the Cold War; the cultural and political movements of the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s; Vietnam; the return of conservatism; globalization; life in the new information age; the post-Cold War era; and race and ethnicity. The Fourth Edition extends its consideration of the period since the 1960s by adding two entirely new chapters and substantially reconfiguring others. In this way, this edition devotes far more attention to the 1970s, a period that has received especially notable scholarly scrutiny in the last few years, and to the period since the end of the Cold War. Key pedagogical elements of the Major Problems format have been retained: chapter introductions, headnotes, and suggested readings.</p><p>Natasha Zaretsky is an Associate Professor of History at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art.

"And his name is David Copperfield."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all of Dickens's novels, David Copperfield most closely reflects the events of his own life. The story of an abandoned waif who discovers life and love in an indifferent world, this classic tale of childhood is populated with a cast of eccentrics, innocents, and villains who number among the author's greatest creations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"David Copperfield is filled with characters of the most astonishing variety, vividness, and originality," noted Somerset Maugham. "They are not realistic and yet they abound with life. There never were such people as the Micawbers, Pegotty and Barkis, Traddles, Betsey Trotwood and Mr. Dick, Uriah Heep and his mother. They are fantastic inventions of Dickens's exultant imagination, but they have so much vigor, they are so consistent, they are presented with so much conviction, that you believe in them. They are extravagant, but not unreal, and when you have once to know them you can never quite forget them." T. S. Eliot agreed: "Dickens excelled in character; in the creation of characters of greater intensity than human beings." And Virginia Woolf concluded: "In David Copperfield, though char-<br>acters swarm and life flows into every creek and cranny, some common feelings--youth, gaiety, hope--envelops the tumult, brings the scattered parts together, and invests the most perfect of all the Dickens novels with an atmosphere of beauty." <br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

That's the heart of the principles and teachings of Magda Gerber, founder of RIE (Resources for Infant Educarers), and Educaring. BABY KNOWS BEST is based on Gerber's belief in babies' natural abilities to develop at their own pace, without coaxing from helicoptering or hovering parents. The Educaring Approach helps parents see their infants as competent people with a growing ability to communicate, problem-solve, and self-soothe.<br><br>BABY KNOWS BEST is a comprehensive resource that<i> </i>shows parents how to respond to their babies' cues and signals; how to develop healthy sleep habits; why babies need uninterrupted playtime; and how to set clear, consistent limits.

But what exactly are those members of the elite doing with their newfound influence? <i>The One Percent Solution </i>provides an answer to this question for the first time. Gordon Lafer's book is a comprehensive account of legislation promoted by the nation's biggest corporate lobbies across all fifty state legislatures and encompassing a wide range of labor and economic policies.In an era of growing economic insecurity, it turns out that one of the main reasons life is becoming harder for American workers is a relentless&#x2015;and concerted&#x2015;offensive by the country&#x2019;s best-funded and most powerful political forces: corporate lobbies empowered by the Supreme Court to influence legislative outcomes with an endless supply of cash. These actors have successfully championed hundreds of new laws that lower wages, eliminate paid sick leave, undo the right to sue over job discrimination, and cut essential public services.Lafer shows how corporate strategies have been shaped by twenty-first-century conditions&#x2015;including globalization, economic decline, and the populism reflected in both the Trump and Sanders campaigns of 2016. Perhaps most important, Lafer shows that the corporate legislative agenda has come to endanger the scope of democracy itself. For anyone who wants to know what to expect from corporate-backed Republican leadership in Washington, D.C., there is no better guide than this record of what the same set of actors has been doing in the state legislatures under its control.</p></p><p><p>Gordon Lafer is Associate Professor at the Labor Education and Research Center at the University of Oregon.

He has served as Senior Policy Advisor for the U.S. Congress and has been called to testify as an expert witness before multiple state legislatures.</p><p>"<i>The One Percent Solution </i>is a must-read for all who want to ensure the revival and survival of American democracy."</p> (Margaret Levi, Sara Miller McCune Director, Center for Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS), Stanford University)<br><br><p>"For anyone who doubts that corporations are just as coordinated as they ever have been, or that the most critical issues on their agenda are eliminating unions, reducing the minimum wage, and limiting government social benefits, then this highly original and comprehensive examination of their shared legislative priorities and successes in all fifty states is now the one best book you can read."</p> (G. William Domhoff, Distinguished Professor Emeritus and Research Professor, University of CaliforniaSanta Cruz, author of <i>Who Rules America? </i>)<br><br><p>"Gordon Lafer's <i>The One Percent Solution</i> leaves no stone unturned in exposing how corporations&#x2019; conscious political strategy has made life harder for American workers by promoting bad ideas such as 'right to work&#x2019; and a flat-lined minimum wage. I commend Lafer for shining a light on the manipulations of corporate special interests. Workers simply cannot wait any longer. Now more than ever, every American should read this book."</p> (US Representative Rosa DeLauro)<br><br><p>"Gordon Lafer's <i>One Percent Solution</i> is must reading for anyone who wants to understand inequality in the twenty-first century. He puts names and faces to the powerful corporations who have used their political influence to shape America&#x2019;s economy. Lafer takes us into corporate boardrooms to show us a shockingly ambitious agenda to remake the American economy. Kudos to Lafer for writing a book that breaks new ground, is interesting to read, and will be of great interest to general readers, political junkies, and college students alike."</p> (Peter Dreier, E.P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental College)<br><br><p>"In <i>The One Percent Solution</i>, Gordon Lafer exposes the vast conspiracy between corporate special interests and their allies in government to rig the rules of our economy and democracy to favor the wealthy few. Anyone who is committed to turning the tide back in favor of working people must first understand what we are up against&#x2015;and that means reading this book."</p> (Richard L. Trumka, President, AFL-CIO)<br><br><p>"In an age of divided government and Congressional gridlock, Gordon Lafer shows that a handful of the nation's most conservative business lobbying organizations were still able to get some of the public policies that they want&#x2015;by focusing their efforts on state legislatures. This book reveals the outlines of a coordinated lobbying campaign that could have the effect of increasing economic and political inequality in America."</p> (Isaac William Martin, University of California, San Diego, author of <i>Rich People&#x2019;s Movements: Grassroots Campaigns to Untax the One Percent</i>)</p><h2>Seeley&#39;s Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology</h2><p>Designed for the one-semester course, <i>Seeley's Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology</i> is written to allow instructors the ability to accomplish one overall goal: to teach the basics of A&amp;P while fostering the skill of problem solving.

Temples were not places you visited once a week; they were centers of community, divine work, healing, and wisdom, places where Heaven and Earth meet. This union of Heaven and Earth--the sacred temple--is also a union of Thoth and Isis: the Egyptian god of wisdom and the creative cosmic force and the Egyptian goddess of civilizing knowledge. Their relationship established the celestial teachings on Earth, for Thoth taught Isis all the mysteries and magic she knows and Isis acted as Thoth&#x2019;s instrument to deliver the teachings in a form humanity could use. <br> <br>In this initiatic guide to temple building on the spiritual and physical planes, Normandi Ellis and Nicki Scully explain how to create a communal spiritual structure for connecting with the ancient Egyptian pantheon as well as how to consecrate yourself and become a vessel suitable for divine wisdom and a home for your personal gods.

They explore teachings that help you develop relationships with the Egyptian neteru and realize your place within the family of the Egyptian pantheon. They guide you as you create your inner heart temple, the adytum, a safe place in which to receive guidance and access your higher spiritual bodies and oracular gifts. They provide shamanic journeys and initiations on ascension, shamanic death and renewal, soul retrieval and healing, multidimensional realities, and more. <br> <br>By creating a sacred temple within and without, we each can take part in the union of Isis and Thoth and restore the magic of the Egyptian mysteries to our time.</p><p>Normandi Ellis is an award-winning writer, workshop facilitator, clairvoyant, and spiritualist minister.

In this landmark book, the first in many years to take in the whole sweep of national fiction, Lawrence Buell reanimates this supposedly antiquated idea, demonstrating that its history is a key to the dynamics of national literature and national identity itself.</p><p>The dream of the G.A.N., as Henry James nicknamed it, crystallized soon after the Civil War. In fresh, in-depth readings of selected contenders from the 1850s onward in conversation with hundreds of other novels, Buell delineates four "scripts" for G.A.N. candidates. One, illustrated by <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, is the adaptation of the novel's story-line by later writers, often in ways that are contrary to the original author's own design. Other aspirants, including <i>The Great Gatsby</i> and <i>Invisible Man,</i> engage the American Dream of remarkable transformation from humble origins. A third script, seen in <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> and <i>Beloved</i>, is the family saga that grapples with racial and other social divisions. Finally,mega-novels from <i>Moby-Dick</i> to <i>Gravity's Rainbow</i> feature assemblages of characters who dramatize in microcosm the promise and pitfalls of democracy.</p><p>The canvas of the great American novel is in constant motion, reflecting revolutions in fictional fashion, the changing face of authorship, and the inseparability of high culture from popular. As Buell reveals, the elusive G.A.N. showcases the myth of the United States as a nation perpetually under construction.</p></p><p>Lawrence Buell is Powell M.

Buell can summarize an argument or a plot with eye-opening precision&#x2015;and make you suddenly see new things in familiar books... The grateful audience for this book will be other scholars and teachers of American literature, who will plunder its pages for decades to come. And plunder it they will because, all cavils aside, Buell proffers brilliant analyses of a dozen or so front-runners in the Great American Novel sweepstakes.

(Michael Gorra <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2014-02-08)<br><br><b>Lawrence Buell</b>...deserves congratulations for taking on this broad and controversial subject... Whether it survives or has ever existed, the GAN is really just a critical peg on which Buell hangs some fine analyses of canonical American novels. (Elaine Showalter <i>Prospect</i> 2014-03-01)<br><br>Rich in critical insight, <b>Buell</b>&#x2019;s analysis locates scores of novels in its interpretive mosaic. And even in a conclusion suggesting that America&#x2019;s global decline dims the prospects for its realization, Buell wonders if the [Great American Novel] isn&#x2019;t stirring again in surprising new developments in science fiction. An impressively ambitious literary survey. (Bryce Christensen <i>Booklist (starred review)</i> 2014-01-01)<br><br>Although readers will encounter many usually canonized suspects, <b>Buell</b>&#x2019;s scope is wide enough to encompass the varieties of novelists&#x2019; imaginations and to consider the implications of multiculturalism and globalism in redefining the future of American fiction. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2013-11-01)<br><br>Impressive in scope, erudition, and detail...<b>Buell</b> sees well beyond the canonical Great White Males and perceives American studies as a properly &#x2018;transnational&#x2019; and &#x2018;transpacific&#x2019; profession. Buell&#x2019;s engaging book should itself become a landmark of American studies, as it exemplifies precisely why great literature needs to be read and taught. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2013-11-11)<br><br>Wide-ranging and astute, <b>Lawrence Buell</b>&#x2019;s literary history revolves around an unkillable dream, around scripts that make some texts institutions. (Wai Chee Dimock, Yale University)<br><br><b>Lawrence Buell</b> has read and mastered every novel you can think of and many you have never heard of. One result, among many others, is the definitive study of a concept so tenacious&#x2015;and so caught between idea, claim, sham, and belief&#x2015;that no major writer in the culture has ever been able to avoid it. The idea of The Great American Novel has been capitalized in fame, shame, and ridicule over the years, but no one before Buell has given it the full understanding it deserves. This book marvelously captures the compulsive but ever-changing communal needs that have made the idea of America a fictional playground for every writer and reader in the nation. (Robert A. Ferguson, author of <i>Alone in America: The Stories that Matter</i>)<br><br>Demonstrating an enviable command of the full sweep of modern literary history, but also an expert eye for the telling individual case, <b>Buell</b>&#x2019;s analysis of the dream of the Great American Novel is itself a great work of Americanist literary criticism, brilliantly faithful both to the anachronism and the continuing urgency of the idea at its heart. One comes away from this highly readable book with a new understanding of how certain works of literature have made themselves matter to American readers and, what&#x2019;s more, an exquisitely balanced sense of the prospects for the novel&#x2019;s future as an expression of national identity&#x2015;and national discord. (Mark McGurl, Stanford University)<br><br>As I read this book I was excited by the unexpectedness, even brilliance of many of its commentaries. This is an important work that every scholar of American literature and many who are not, will want to read. It redefines the concept of the Great American Novel and rethinks the nature of the canonical for our contemporary critical times.

Volume II contains 142&nbsp;&nbsp;unabridged tales, including such bedtime favorites as&nbsp;&nbsp;"Snow White and Rose Red" and "The&nbsp;&nbsp;Worn-Out Dancing Shoes," as well as 32 little-known&nbsp;&nbsp;tales that the Brothers Grimm omitted during the&nbsp;&nbsp;course of their many revisions. These wonderful&nbsp;&nbsp;tales of life, passion, and make-believe appeal not&nbsp;&nbsp;only to children--who unabashedly love them--but&nbsp;&nbsp;to readers of any age.</p><p></p><h2>Sense and Sensibility: An Annotated Edition</h2><p><p><i>Sense and Sensibility</i> (1811) marked the auspicious debut of a novelist identified only as "A Lady." Jane Austen's name has since become as familiar as Shakespeare's, and her tale of two sisters has lost none of its power to delight. Patricia Meyer Spacks guides readers to a deeper appreciation of the richness of Austen's delineation of her heroines, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, as they experience love, romance, and heartbreak. On display again in the editor's running commentary are the wit and light touch that delighted readers of Spacks's <i>Pride and Prejudice: An Annotated Edition</i>.</p><p>In her notes, Spacks elucidates language and allusions that have become obscure (What are Nabobs? When is rent day?), draws comparisons to Austen's other work and to that of her precursors, and gives an idea of how other critics have seen the novel. In her introduction and annotations, she explores Austen's sympathy with both Elinor and Marianne, the degree to which the sisters share "sense" and "sensibility," and how they must learn from each other. Both manage to achieve security and a degree of happiness by the novel's end. Austen's romance, however, reveals darker overtones, and Spacks does not leave unexamined the issue of the social and psychological restrictions of women in Austen's era.</p><p>As with other volumes in Harvard's series of Austen novels, <i>Sense and Sensibility: An Annotated Edition</i> comes handsomely illustrated with numerous color reproductions that vividly recreate Austen's world.

Crosby, <i>Southwestern Historical Quarterly</i>), "a standard work in its field" (William Cronon, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>), and "one of the classic amalgamations of geography and history in the current literature" (Kenneth C. Martis, <i>Journal of American History</i>). In this new volume, the second in a projected four-volume series, D. W. Meinig again provides a fresh interpretation of the American past, bringing his special geographical perspective to the years between 1800 and 1867, the period when the nation experienced a dramatic expansion in territory, population, economy, and political tension that culminated in the Civil War. As in his first volume, <i>Atlantic America,</i> Meinig assesses the characteristics of regions and political territories and the relations among them, examining the dual roles played by geopolitics and ethnoculture in the shaping of the United States.<br> <br> Meinig emphasizes the flux, uncertainty, and unpredictability of the expansion into continental America, showing how a multitude of individuals confronted complex and problematic issues. He discusses, for example, Jefferson's options regarding the Louisiana Purchase and the effects of his decisions on the Louisianians, and later controversies about U.S. pressures on Mexico and Cuba. He carefully traces the expansion of distinct regional societies and the social and geographical repositioning of various peoples (Indians, African-Americans, and subgroups of each). He describes and assesses the emerging patterns of cities, waterways, roads, railways, and attempts at national planning. And he presents the geopolitical alternatives considered in dealing with initial secessions, and the ragged tearing apart of the nation in 1861. Throughout, Meinig places the United States in its broader North American context, focusing on its relations with Canada, Mexico, and the West Indies.<br> <br> Richly illustrated with maps, plans, and scenes, many of which were specially prepared for the book, <i>Continental America</i> is at once an invaluable complement to and a penetrating critique of more ordinary American histories.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Continental America offers a rather different way of looking at a period of enormous expansion, development, and crisis in the career of the United States. Although it stands as a discrete, coherent work, it is best understood as a continuation of the special kind of description and assessment set forth in Atlantic America, 1492-1800, the opening volume of this geographic interpretation.<b>D.W. Meinig</b> is Maxwell Research Professor of Geography at Syracuse University.<br></p><h2>Art Students&#39; Anatomy (Dover Anatomy for Artists)</h2><p>For art students working with the human figure, this comprehensive study of the bones, muscles, and surface forms of the living body will be one of the most useful (and most used) additions they can make to their private libraries. More than 150 illustrations, mostly full-page photographs and labeled sketches of undraped male and female bodies, provide the reader with anatomical studies of unrivaled clarity and unquestioned accuracy. <br>After an introduction covering the proportions of the adult male, the adult female, and the infant at various ages, the author devotes 50 pages to the human skeletal system. Besides pictures and detailed drawings of the major bones of the body, he also includes x-rays showing the bone structure of the hand and foot and the movements of the shoulder, elbow, and knee joints. <br>A section on the muscular system follows, including reproductions of the remarkable Albinus engravings ("The most beautiful and among the most accurate anatomical figures ever published." &#x2014; Charles Singer), 36 photographs and labeled sketches of living models, and seven drawings showing the attachments of muscles to the skeleton. The book concludes with a number of poses and action photographs illustrating surface anatomy in various actions such as dancing and throwing a ball.<br>This is one of the few and perhaps the best of those books that teach anatomy using chiefly living objects for their illustrative work. By doing so, it fills an urgent need, for most art students cannot afford living models or expensive courses in anatomy. Now, however, they can use this practical and inexpensive home-study course to achieve a clearer insight into the complicated mechanism of the human body, as simplified by Dr. Farris.</p><p></p><h2>Scaffolding Children&#39;s Learning: Vygotsky and Early Childhood Education (Naeyc Research Into Practice Series, Vol. 7)</h2><p>Both scholarly and highly readable, this timely volume will be welcomed by early childhood educators, teachers, and students.

This cookbook will help you: Understand the basics of regular expressions through a concise tutorial Use regular expressions effectively in several programming and scripting languages Learn how to validate and format input Manage words, lines, special characters, and numerical values Find solutions for using regular expressions in URLs, paths, markup, and data exchange Learn the nuances of mor</p><p><p> Whether you're a novice or an experienced user, <i>Regular Expressions Cookbook</i> will help deepen your understanding of the tool. You'll learn powerful new tricks, avoid language-specific gotchas, and save valuable time with this huge library of proven solutions to difficult, real-world problems. </p> <p> <strong>Searching and Replacing with Regular Expressions</strong> <br> Search-and-replace is a common job for regular expressions. A search-and-replace function takes a subject string, a regular expression, and a replacement string as input. The output is the subject string with all matches of the regular expression replaced with the replacement text. Although the replacement text is not a regular expression at all, you can use certain special syntax to build dynamic replacement texts. All flavors let you reinsert the text matched by the regular expression or a capturing group into the replacement. Recipes 2.20 and 2.21 explain this. Some flavors also support inserting matched context into the replacement text, as Recipe 2.22 shows. In Chapter 3, Recipe 3.16 teaches you how to generate a different replacement text for each match in code. </p> <p> <strong>Many Flavors of Replacement Text</strong> <br> Different ideas by different regular expression software developers have led to a wide range of regular expression flavors, each with different syntax and feature sets. The story for the replacement text is no different. In fact, there are even more replacement text flavors than regular expression flavors. Building a regular expression engine is difficult. Most programmers prefer to reuse an existing one, and bolting a search-and-replace function onto an existing regular expression engine is quite easy. The result is that there are many replacement text flavors for regular expression libraries that do not have built-in search-and-replace features. <br> Fortunately, all the regular expression flavors in this book have corresponding replacement text flavors, except PCRE. This gap in PCRE complicates life for programmers who use flavors based on it. The open source PCRE library does not include any functions to make replacements. Thus, all applications and programming languages that are based on PCRE need to provide their own search-and-replace function. Most programmers try to copy existing syntax, but never do so in exactly the same way. <br> This book covers the following replacement text flavors. Refer to &#x201c;Many Flavors of Regular Expressions&#x201d; on page 2 for more details on the regular expression flavors that correspond with the replacement text flavors: <br> <b>Perl</b> <br> Perl has built-in support for regular expression substitution via the s/regex/ replace/ operator. The Perl replacement text flavor corresponds with the Perl regular expression flavor. This book covers Perl 5.6 to Perl 5.10. The latter version adds support for named backreferences in the replacement text, as it adds named capture to the regular expression syntax. <br> <b>PHP</b> <br> In this book, the PHP replacement text flavor refers to the preg_replace function in PHP. This function uses the PCRE regular expression flavor and the PHP replacement text flavor. <br> Other programming languages that use PCRE do not use the same replacement text flavor as PHP. Depending on where the designers of your programming language got their inspiration, the replacement text syntax may be similar to PHP or any of the other replacement text flavors in this book. PHP also has an ereg_replace function. This function uses a different regular expression flavor (POSIX ERE), and a different replacement text flavor, too. PHP&#x2019;s ereg functions are not discussed in this book. <br> <b>.NET</b> <br> The System.Text.RegularExpressions package provides various searchand- replace functions. The .NET replacement text flavor corresponds with the .NET regular expression flavor. All versions of .NET use the same replacement text flavor. The new regular expression features in .NET 2.0 do not affect the replacement text syntax. <br> <b>Java</b> <br> The java.util.regex package has built-in search-and-replace functions. This book covers Java 4, 5, and 6. All use the same replacement text syntax. <br> <b>JavaScript</b> <br> In this book, we use the term JavaScript to indicate both the replacement text flavor and the regular expression flavor defined in Edition 3 of the ECMA-262 standard. <br> <b>Python</b> <br> Python&#x2019;s re module provides a sub function to search-and-replace. The Python replacement text flavor corresponds with the Python regular expression flavor. This book covers Python 2.4 and 2.5. Python&#x2019;s regex support has been stable for many years. <br> <b>Ruby</b> <br> Ruby&#x2019;s regular expression support is part of the Ruby language itself, including the search-and-replace function. This book covers Ruby 1.8 and 1.9. A default compilation of Ruby 1.8 uses the regular expression flavor provided directly by the Ruby source code, whereas a default compilation of Ruby 1.9 uses the Oniguruma regular expression library. Ruby 1.8 can be compiled to use Oniguruma, and Ruby 1.9 can be compiled to use the older Ruby regex flavor. In this book, we denote the native Ruby flavor as Ruby 1.8, and the Oniguruma flavor as Ruby 1.9. The replacement text syntax for Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 is the same, except that Ruby 1.9 adds support for named backreferences in the replacement text. Named capture is a new feature in Ruby 1.9 regular expressions. </p>Detailed Solutions in Eight Programming Languages</p><h2>In Search of Lost Time, Volume 4: Sodom and Gomorrah</h2><p>1. Time is a central concern for Proust, appearing first in the title and last as the final word of the novel. What is his vision of the past? Does he have a vision of the present? The future? Can the Narrator be said to be living in the past? Is he like the White Queen in Through the Looking-Glass , with &#39;jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam today&#39;? 2. The renowned translator of Proust, C. K. Scott Moncrieff, originally grouped the opening section of In Search of Lost Time under the title &#39;The Overture,&#39; which includes two famous passages, the good night kiss and the evocative taste of the madeleine. Does this seem apt? If so, how might this fifty-odd page beginning prefigure what will transpire later? What would you expect to follow, given that an overture usually introduces the main themes of a musical work? What does it suggest about Proust&#39;s conception of literature and music? 3. The episode of the good night kiss strikes some readers as odd or contradictory: the Narrator&#39;s need for a kiss seems almost infantile, while his power of observation seems extraordinarily precocious. Considering that he is sent to bed at eight o&#39;clock, how old do you think the Narrator is? Is it significant that his father suggests the Narrator be given the kiss he craves, whereas his mother is reluctant, saying &#39;We mustn&#39;t let the child get into the habit . . .&#39;? Is the fact that the Narrator succeeds in getting the kiss he wants a good thing or a bad thing? Why? 4. &#39;The whole of Proust&#39;s world comes out of a teacup,&#39; observed Samuel Beckett. Indeed the episode of the madeleine dipped in tea is the first (and most famous) of numerous instances of &#39;involuntary memory&#39; in the novel. A recognized psychological phenomenon triggered by smells, tastes, or sounds, involuntary memory vividly reproduces emotions, sensations, or images from the past. Why do you think readers and critics universally consider this scene to be pivotal? What does the Narrator think about the experience of involuntary memory? What might its function be in the scheme of In Search of Lost Time ? 5. Another emblematic theme involves the recurring &#39;little phrase&#39; of music by Vinteuil that catches the ear of Swann at the Verdurin&#39;s salon and steals into his life. How do Vinteuil&#39;s compositions stir both Swann and the Narrator? In Proust&#39;s scheme of things, is music a higher art than painting or writing because it can produce involuntary memories? How does involuntary memory affect writing and painting? Is it unrelated to art except as a necessary catalyst? 6. In &#39;Combray&#39; we are introduced to the Narrator&#39;s family, their household, and their country home. Since Paris is the true heart of upper-class France, why do you think Proust chose to begin In Search of Lost Time elsewhere? What do we learn from the Narrator&#39;s description of his family&#39;s life and habits? Is the household dominated by men or by women? Does the Narrator&#39;s account seem accurate, or is it colored by his own ideas and preoccupations? 7. A madeleine dipped into a cup of tea first impelled Proust into the &#39;remembrance of things past.&#39; Though Proust was a gourmet in his youth, in the final years of his life he subsisted mainly on fillets of sole, chicken, fried potatoes, ice cream, cakes, fruit, and iced beer. Consider how food and culinary happenings - from meals at the restaurant in the Grand Hotel in Balbec to dinners at La Raspeli�re and the Guermantes&#39;s in Paris - form an integral part of the work. 8. Swann&#39;s Way and the Guermantes Way are presented as mutually exclusive choices for promenades, with Swann&#39;s Way given primacy of place at the novel&#39;s outset. Where, metaphorically speaking, does Swann&#39;s Way seem to lead? What are the aesthetic signposts and milestones the Narrator points out? What does the landscape around Combray represent? 9. &#39;I want my work to be a sort of cathedral in literature,&#39; Proust once said. In his description of the area around Combray - and in many other places in the novel - the Narrator describes churches, and particularly steeples. Indeed, Howard Moss cites the steeple as one of Proust&#39;s most important symbols. In religious architecture, the steeple represents man&#39;s aspiration toward God, and by inference toward Art, the Proustian religion. What else might it suggest? Does it have a counterpart in nature? 10. Proust and the Narrator share an appreciation of gardens and flowers - Proust himself was eager to visit Monet&#39;s celebrated garden - and in a sense, all Combray can be seen as a garden. What associations does this evoke? How does the Narrator respond to natural beauty? What do flowers mean to him? How do we know? 11. Proust&#39;s work is filled with &#39;doubling&#39; - the most obvious being the identification of the author with a fictional self of the same name but with somewhat different characteristics. Is Swann a double of the Narrator? What qualities do they share? In what ways do they seem different? What is the importance of the fact that Swann is a Jew? 12. Louis Auchincloss questions the use of a fictional first person named &#39;Marcel,&#39; who is but isn&#39;t Proust. Marcel claims that he is neither a snob nor a homosexual, yet he is obsessed with both. Would Proust have strengthened Marcel&#39;s viewpoint by making it that of the young social climber that he himself so clearly was? Did he enhance or detract from Marcel&#39;s credibility by casting him as one of the few heterosexuals in the book? Does it matter that Marcel regards &#39;inversion&#39; as a dangerous vice? Did Proust? 13. &#39;Swann in Love&#39; might be thought of as a dress rehearsal for the Narrator&#39;s own performance, and Swann&#39;s passion for Odette establishes a model for various other love relationships that appear later in the book. Proust believed that all emotions and behavior obey certain psychological laws. E. M. Forster maintained that &#39;Proust&#39;s general theory of human intercourse is that the fonder we are of people the less we understand them - the theory of the complete pessimist.&#39; Do you agree? How does Swann&#39;s love affair reflect this? What conclusions does the Narrator draw from his perception of Swann&#39;s experience? In what way does this differ from Swann&#39;s own view? 14. The Balbec sequence of Within a Budding Grove gathers a group of the novel&#39;s principal characters, many for the first time: Robert de Saint-Loup, the Baron de Charlus, and Albertine, to name three of the most important. Others begin to emerge in their true significance, like Elstir the painter. Why do you think Proust chose to bring them together in Balbec? In what ways does Balbec echo or amplify Combray? Is the little &#39;society&#39; of Balbec a preview in microcosm of Paris? 15. While writing In Search of Lost Time Proust often rummaged through his vast photographic collection of Belle �poque luminaries as a means of stimulating his memory. &#39;You could see that his thoughts were following a kind of underground track, as if he were organizing everything into images before putting them into words,&#39; recalled his maid C�leste Albaret. Indeed, the Baron de Charlus, in Within a Budding Grove , speaks of the special importance of photographs in preserving an unsullied moment of time past, before it has been altered by the present. Discuss how Proust used photographs in the story - just as he exploited the technology of trains, cars, and airplanes - as symbols of passing time. 16. In his landmark essay on Proust, Edmund Wilson praises the broad Dickensian humor and extravagant satire that animate vast sections of In Search of Lost Time , yet he goes on to call it &#39;one of the gloomiest books ever written.&#39; Can you reconcile Wilson&#39;s remarks? 17.

As with the previous editions, this edition has a clear presentation of fundamentals and an exceptional collection of examples, solved problems and exercises. <p>The text integrates laboratory experiences, both hardware and computer simulation, while not making them mandatory for following the main flow of the chapters. Design is emphasized throughout, and switching algebra is developed as a tool for analyzing and implementing digital systems. The presentation includes excellent coverage of minimization of combinational circuits, including multiple output ones, using the Karnaugh map and iterated consensus. There are a number of examples of the design of larger systems, both combinational and sequential, using medium scale integrated circuits and programmable logic devices. </p><p>The third edition features two chapters on sequential systems. The first chapter covers analysis of sequential systems and the second covers design. Complete coverage of the analysis and design of synchronous sequential systems adds to the comprehensive nature of the text.

Or that Asian Americans are most susceptible to heart attacks on the fourth day of the month? Or that drinking a full pot of coffee every morning will add years to your life, but one cup a day increases the risk of pancreatic cancer? All of these &#x201c;facts&#x201d; have been argued with a straight face by credentialed researchers and backed up with reams of data and convincing statistics. As Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning economist Ronald Coase once cynically observed, &#x201c;If you torture data long enough, it will confess.&#x201d; Lying with statistics is a time-honored con. In Standard Deviations, economics professor Gary Smith walks us through the various tricks and traps that people use to back up their own crackpot theories. Sometimes, the unscrupulous deliberately try to mislead us. Other times, the well-intentioned are blissfully unaware of the mischief they are committing. Today, data is so plentiful that researchers spend precious little time distinguishing between good, meaningful indicators and total rubbish. Not only do others use data to fool us, we fool ourselves. With the breakout success of Nate Silver&#x2019;s The Signal and the Noise, the once humdrum subject of statistics has never been hotter. Drawing on breakthrough research in behavioral economics by luminaries like Daniel Kahneman and Dan Ariely and taking to task some of the conclusions of Freakonomics author Steven D. Levitt, Standard Deviations demystifies the science behind statistics and makes it easy to spot the fraud all around.

The sad truth is that &#x201c;facts&#x201d; like these are routinely presented with a straight face by credentialed academics and backed up with reams of raw data. In Standard Deviations, Smith skillfully unpacks the various ways we are duped by data every day. He deftly demonstrates how a straightforward set of findings can be teased and manipulated to reflect whatever the researcher wants to see.</p><p>Lying with statistics is a time-honored con, and in this age of Big Data even the most accredited findings can be suspect. Blending the keen statistical eye of Nate Silver with the probing insights of Daniel Kahneman and Dan Ariely, Smith demystifies the math behind the dismal science, making it easy to spot flaws all around and find the truth hidden in plain sight.</p><p>MORE ADVANCE PRAISE FOR <b>STANDARD DEVIATIONS</b></p><p>&#x201c;Gary Smith&#x2019;s <i>Standard Deviations</i> is both a statement of principles for doing statistical inference correctly and a practical guide for interpreting the (supposedly) data-based inferences other people have drawn.

THE POTENT COMBINATION of fast computers and worldwide connectivity is continually praised&#x2014;even worshipped. Over and over, we are told that government, business, finance, medicine, law, and our daily lives are being revolutionized by a newfound ability to sift through reams of data and discover the truth. We can make wise decisions because powerful computers have looked at the data and seen the light.</p><p>Maybe. Or maybe not. Sometimes these omnipresent data and magnificent computers lead to some pretty outlandish discoveries. Case in point, serious people have seriously claimed that:</p><p></p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Messy rooms make people racist.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unborn chicken embryos can influence computer random-event generators.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ratio of government debt to GDP goes above 90 percent, nations nearly always slip into recession.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as 50 percent of the drop in the crime rate in the United States over the past twenty years is because of legalized abortion.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking two cups of coffee a day substantially increases the risk of pancreatic cancer.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most successful companies tend to become less successful, while the least successful companies tend to become more successful, so that soon all will be mediocre.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athletes who appear on the cover of <i>Sports Illustrated</i> or <i>Madden NFL</i> are jinxed in that they are likely to be less successful or injured.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living near power lines causes cancer in children.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans have the power to postpone death until after important ceremonial occasions.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian Americans are more susceptible to heart attacks on the fourth day of the month.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People live three to five years longer if they have positive initials, like ACE.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baseball players whose first names began with the letter D die, on average, two years younger than players whose first names began with the letters E through Z.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terminally ill can be cured by positive mental energy sent from thousands of miles away.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an NFC team wins the Super Bowl, the stock market almost always goes up.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can beat the stock market by buying the Dow Jones stock with the highest dividend yield and the second lowest price per share.</p><p></p><p>These claims&#x2014;and hundreds more like them&#x2014;appear in newspapers and magazines every day even though they are surely false. In today&#x2019;s Information Age, our beliefs and actions are guided by torrents of meaningless data. It is not hard to see why we repeatedly draw false inferences and make bad decisions. Even if we are reasonably well informed, we are not always alert to the ways in which data are biased or irrelevant, or to the ways in which scientific research is flawed or misleading. We tend to assume that computers are infallible&#x2014;that no matter what kind of garbage we put in, computers will spit out gospel. It happens not just to laymen in their daily lives, but in serious research by diligent professionals. We see it in the popular press, on television, on the Internet, in political campaigns, in academic journals, in business meetings, in courtrooms, and, of course, in government hearings.</p><p>Decades ago, when data were scarce and computers nonexistent, researchers worked hard to gather good data and thought carefully before spending hours, even days, on painstaking calculations. Now with data so plentiful, researchers often spend too little time distinguishing between good data and rubbish, between sound analysis and junk science. And, worst of all, we are too quick to assume that churning through mountains of data can&#x2019;t ever go wrong. We rush to make decisions based on the balderdash these machines dish out&#x2014;to increase taxes in the midst of a recession, to trust our life savings to financial quants who impress us because we don&#x2019;t understand them, to base business decisions on the latest management fad, to endanger our health with medical quackery, and&#x2014;worst of all&#x2014;to give up coffee.</p><p>Ronald Coase cynically observed that, &#x201c;If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.&#x201d; <i>Standard Deviations</i> is an exploration of dozens of examples of tortuous assertions that, with even a moment&#x2019;s reflection, don&#x2019;t pass the smell test. Sometimes, the unscrupulous deliberately try to mislead us. Other times, the well-intentioned are blissfully unaware of the mischief they are committing. My intention in writing this book is to help protect us from errors&#x2014;both external and self-inflicted. You will learn simple guidelines for recognizing bull when you see it&#x2014;or say it. Not only do others use data to fool us, we often fool ourselves.</p><p>1</p><p>PATTERNS, PATTERNS, PATTERNS</p><p>YOUTH SOCCER IS A VERY BIG DEAL WHERE I LIVE IN SOUTHERN California. It&#x2019;s a fun, inexpensive sport that can be played by boys and girls of all sizes and shapes. I initially didn&#x2019;t know anything about soccer. All I knew was that, every weekend, the city parks and school grounds were filled with kids in brightly colored uniforms chasing soccer balls while their parents cheered. When my son was old enough, we were in.</p><p>By the time the 2010 World Cup came around, my son was playing on one of the top soccer teams in Southern California. I was the manager and a fanatic about soccer, so naturally he and I watched every World Cup match we could. The opponents in the 2010 championship game were Netherlands and Spain, two extraordinarily talented teams from underachieving nations that often disappointed their supporters. Which country would finally win the World Cup? I loved the Dutch, who had won all six of their World Cup games, scoring twelve goals while allowing only five, and had knocked out the mighty Brazil and Uruguay. But then I heard about Paul the octopus, who had correctly predicted the winners of seven World Cup games by choosing food from plastic boxes with the nations&#x2019; flags on them. Paul the Oracle had picked Spain, and the world now seemed certain of a Spanish victory.</p><p>What the heck was going on? How could a slimy, pea-brained invertebrate know more about soccer than I did? I laughed and waited for Paul the Omniscient to get his comeuppance. Except he didn&#x2019;t. The Dutch did not play with their usual creativity and flair. In a brutal, cynical match, with fourteen yellow cards&#x2014;nine given to the dirty Dutchmen&#x2014;Spain scored the winning goal with four minutes left in the game.</p><p>How could an octopus living in a tank have predicted any of this? Had Paul ever seen a soccer game? Did Paul even have a brain?</p><p>It turns out that octopuses are among the most intelligent invertebrates, but that isn&#x2019;t saying much&#x2014;sort of like being the world&#x2019;s tallest midget. Still, Paul made eight World Cup predictions and got every single one right. Not only that, Paul made six predictions during the 2008 European Football Championships and got four right. Overall, that&#x2019;s twelve out of fourteen correct, which in the eyes of many would be considered statistical proof of Paul&#x2019;s psychic abilities. But were there really enough data?</p><p>If a fair coin is flipped fourteen times, the chances of twelve or more heads are less than one percent. In the same way, if Paul were just a hapless guesser with a 50 percent chance of making a correct prediction, the probability that he would make so many correct predictions is less than 1 percent, a probability so low that it is considered &#x201c;statistically significant.&#x201d; The chances of Paul being correct so many times are so small that, logically, we can rule out luck as an explanation. With his consistency, Paul had demonstrated that he was not merely a lucky guesser. He was truly Paul the Psychic Octopus!</p><p>And yet, something didn&#x2019;t seem quite right. Is it really possible for an octopus to predict the future? Paul&#x2019;s performance raises several issues that are endemic in statistical studies. Paul was not a psychic (surprise, surprise), but he is a warning of things to watch out for the next time you hear some fanciful claim.</p><p> CONFOUNDING EFFECTS</p><p>First, let&#x2019;s look at how Paul made his predictions. At feeding time, he was shown two clear plastic boxes with the national flags of the opposing teams glued to the front of the boxes. The boxes contained identical yummy treats, such as a mussel or an oyster. Whichever box Paul opened first was the predicted winner.</p><p>Octopuses don&#x2019;t know much about soccer, but they do have excellent eyesight and good memories. One time, an octopus at the New England Aquarium decided he didn&#x2019;t like a volunteer and shot salt water at her whenever he saw her. She left the aquarium to go to college, but when she returned months later, the octopus remembered her and immediately drenched her with salt water again. In an experiment at a Seattle aquarium, one volunteer fed the octopuses while another wearing identical clothes irritated the octopuses with a stick. After a week of this, most of the octopuses could tell who was who. When they saw the good person, they moved closer; when they saw the bad person, they moved away (and sometimes shot water at him for good measure).</p><p>Paul the Psychic Octopus happened to be living in an aquarium in Germany and, except for the Spain-Netherlands World Cup final, Paul only predicted games involving Germany. In eleven of the thirteen games involving Germany, Paul picked Germany&#x2014;and Germany won nine of these eleven games. Was Paul picking Germany because he had analyzed their opponents carefully or because he had an affinity for the German flag? Paul was almost certainly color blind, but experiments have shown that octopuses recognize brightness and are attracted to horizontal shapes. Germany&#x2019;s flag has three vivid horizontal stripes, as do the flags of Serbia and Spain, the only other countries Paul selected. Indeed, the Spanish and German flags are pretty similar, which may explain why Paul picked Spain over Germany in one of the two matches they played and picked Spain over the Netherlands in the World Cup final. The only game in which Paul did not choose the German or Spanish flag was a match between Serbia and Germany.</p><p>The flag was apparently a confounding factor in that Paul wasn&#x2019;t picking the best soccer team. He was choosing his favorite flag. Paul the Omniscient was just a pea-brained octopus after all.</p><p><b>Figure 1.1: Paul&#x2019;s Favorite Flags</b></p><p><b>Germany (eleven times)</b></p><p><b>Spain (twice)</b></p><p><b>Serbia (once)</b></p><p> SELECTIVE REPORTING AND MISREPORTING</p><p>Another explanation for Paul&#x2019;s success is that too many pe...</p></p><h2>Outliers and American Vanguard Art</h2><p>Since the last century, the relationship between vanguard and self-taught artists has been defined by contradiction. The established art world has been quick to&nbsp;make clear distinctions between trained and untrained artists, yet at the same time it has been fascinated by outliers whom it draws selectively and intermittently into its orbits. For a new exhibition launching at the National Gallery of Art, curator Lynne Cooke explores shifting conceptualizations of the American outlier across the twentieth century, drawing on the inherent sociality of the exhibition in her installation of these works. This companion catalog, <i>Outliers and American Vanguard Art</i>, offers a fantastic opportunity to consider works by schooled and self-taught creators in relation to each other and&nbsp;defined by historical circumstance.<br><br> The art works in <i>Outliers and American Vanguard Art</i> come from three distinct periods when the intersections between mainstream and outlier artists were most dynamic and productive, ushering in exhibitions of art based on various degrees of co-existence, inclusion, and assimilation. Works by such diverse artists as Charles Sheeler, Christina Ramberg, and Matt Mullican are set in conversation with a range of&nbsp;works by such&nbsp;self-taught artists as Horace Pippin, Janet Sobel, and Henry Darger. Cooke also examines a recent increase of radically expressive work that challenges what it means to be an outlier today. She reveals how these distinctions have been freighted with a&nbsp;particularly American point of view&nbsp;as she investigates our assumptions about creativity, artistic practice, and the role of the artist in contemporary culture.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Outliers and American Vanguard Art </i>is the most comprehensive show ever to examine outliers in dialogue with their established peers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sure to inspire vigorous conversation about how artists and the work they make are represented.</p><p><b>Lynne Cooke</b> is senior curator, special projects in modern art, at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.

This Lampedusa&#x2019;s final masterpiece, is accompanied here by the parable &#x201c;Joy and the Law&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Blind Kittens,&#x201d; a story originally conceived as the first chapter of a followup to <i>The Leopard</i>.</p><p><b>Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa</b> (1896&#x2013;1957) was a Sicilian nobleman, the Duke of Palma, and the last Prince of Lampedusa. He was born in Palermo to an aristocratic family whose fortunes began to decline in the 1800s with the passage of laws breaking up large Sicilian estates. Lampedusa served as an Italian artillery officer during World War I and was captured by the Austrians and held briefly in a prison camp in Hungary. He remained in the Italian military until 1921 and spent the interwar years traveling through Europe and attempting to restore the family estate. During World War II , the Tomasi palace in Palermo was bombed and looted by Allied troops. In the last two years of his life, Lampedusa began writing and produced his great historical novel<i> Il Gattopardo </i>(<i>The Leopard</i>), as well as several short literary works, none of which were published during his lifetime.

She spent her infancy in a landscape of extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to The Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Albom operates in Port Au Prince.</p><p>With no children of their own, the forty-plus children who live, play, and go to school at the orphanage have become family to Mitch and his wife, Janine. Chika&#x2019;s arrival makes a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delights the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika is suddenly diagnosed with something a doctor there says, &#x201c;No one in Haiti can help you with.&#x201d;</p><p>Mitch and Janine bring Chika to Detroit, hopeful that American medical care can soon return her to her homeland. Instead, Chika becomes a permanent part of their household, and their lives, as they embark on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika&#x2019;s boundless optimism and humor teach Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learns that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost.</p><p>Told in hindsight, and through illuminating conversations with Chika herself, this is Albom at his most poignant and vulnerable. <em>Finding Chika</em> is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed&#x2014;a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made.</p></p><p><p>Mitch Albom is a bestselling author, screenwriter, playwright and nationally syndicated columnist. The author of five consecutive #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, his books have collectively sold more than thirty-three million copies in forty-two languages worldwide. <em>Tuesdays With Morrie</em>, which spent four straight years atop the <em>New York Times</em> list, is now the bestselling memoir of all time. Four of Albom&#x2019;s books, including <em>Morrie, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, For One More Day,</em> and <em>Have a Little Faith</em>, have been made into highly acclaimed TV movies for ABC. Oprah Winfrey produced <em>Tuesdays With Morrie</em>, which claimed four Emmy awards including a best actor nod for Jack Lemmon in the lead role. Albom has founded six charities in and around Detroit, including the first-ever twenty-four-hour medical clinic for homeless children in America, and also operates an orphanage in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti.

Here we have set out before us Bateson&#39;s natural history of the relationship between ideas. This book incorporates writing by both father and daughter, including essays written by Gregory in the last years before his death. There are also conversations-Metalogues-written since then by Mary Catherine to convey the way the two might have worked together to forge the essays into a single work. Angels Fear is a unique demonstration of thinking in progress, playful and wide-ranging, an attempt by the Batesons to find a view of the mind and the universe that is neigher mechanistic nor supernatural</p><p>Bateson was working on this book when he died in 1980 but was nowhere near completing it; his daughter added chapters and other material that she is careful to identify as her own.

Bateson combines ideas from a wide range of sourcescybernetics, communication theory, Jungian psychology, biology, philosophy, evolution theory, ethics, etc.in an attempt to bridge the gap between mind and matter, to present a unified view of nature and man. The discussion is suggestive but lacking in focus. Bateson's fans will love this; others may feel confirmed in their belief that his most important contribution lies elsewherein his theory of the "double bind." Leon H.

The explosion of racial hate and violence in a small Alabama town is viewed by a little girl whose father defends a black man accused of rape.</p><p><i>"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.... When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out."</i><p> Set in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> follows three years in the life of 8-year-old Scout Finch, her brother, Jem, and their father, Atticus--three years punctuated by the arrest and eventual trial of a young black man accused of raping a white woman. Though her story explores big themes, Harper Lee chooses to tell it through the eyes of a child. The result is a tough and tender novel of race, class, justice, and the pain of growing up. </p><p> Like the slow-moving occupants of her fictional town, Lee takes her time getting to the heart of her tale; we first meet the Finches the summer before Scout's first year at school. She, her brother, and Dill Harris, a boy who spends the summers with his aunt in Maycomb, while away the hours reenacting scenes from <i>Dracula</i> and plotting ways to get a peek at the town bogeyman, Boo Radley. At first the circumstances surrounding the alleged rape of Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, barely penetrate the children's consciousness. Then Atticus is called on to defend the accused, Tom Robinson, and soon Scout and Jem find themselves caught up in events beyond their understanding. During the trial, the town exhibits its ugly side, but Lee offers plenty of counterbalance as well--in the struggle of an elderly woman to overcome her morphine habit before she dies; in the heroism of Atticus Finch, standing up for what he knows is right; and finally in Scout's hard-won understanding that most people are essentially kind "when you really see them." By turns funny, wise, and heartbreaking, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> is one classic that continues to speak to new generations, and deserves to be reread often. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Insight Study Guides are written by experts and cover a range of popular literature, plays and films.

In this valuable collection, expert translator David Gasperetti presents three seminal tales that express the major literary, social, and philosophical concerns of late-eighteenth-century Russia. <br> <br>The country�s first bestseller, Matvei Komarov�s Vanka Kain tells the story of a renowned thief and police spy and is also an excellent historical source on the era�s criminal underworld. Mikhail Chulkov�s The Comely Cook is a cross between Moll Flanders, with its comic emphasis on a woman of ill-repute who struggles to secure her place in society, and Tristram Shandy, with its parody of the conventions of novel writing. Finally, Nikolai Karamzin�s \u201cPoor Liza,\u201d the story of a young woman who kills herself over a failed love affair, set the standard for writing sentimentalist fiction in Russia. <br> <br>Taken as a whole, these three works outline the beginnings of modern prose fiction in Russia and also illuminate the literary culture that would give rise to the Golden Age of Russian letters in the middle of the next century.</p></p><p><p>David Gasperetti is associate professor of Russian at the University of Notre Dame and the author of The Rise of the Russian Novel: Carnival, Stylization, and Mockery of the West.</p><p>"Gasperetti&#x2019;s translations are both sparkling and masterful, and they convey the look and the feel of the original texts, both in their linguistic particularity and in their physical structure and appearance."</p> (Marcia A.

Her findings lead to reassessments of patriarchal traditions and of current feminist critiques. Pardes studies women&#39;s plots and subplots, dreams and pursuits, uncovering the diverse and at times conflicting figurations of femininity in biblical texts. She also sketches the ways in which anti-patriarchal elements intermingle with other repressed elements in the Bible: polytheistic traditions, skeptical voices, and erotic longings. The formation of the Hebrew Bible, Pardes shows, entailed not only a concern for unity but also, on occasion, an irresistible attraction toward countertraditions. For her analysis Pardes draws on feminist theory, literary criticism, biblical scholarship, and psychoanalysis. Her discussions of Eve as namegiver, Rachel&#39;s Dream, the Song of the Shulamite, Zipporah&#39;s magical act, and the critique of Job&#39;s wife open new lines of thought for feminist critics, literary critics, biblical scholars, and all readers of the Bible.Ilana Pardes is Lecturer in Comparative Literature and English at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem.</p><h2>Man-Kzin Wars II</h2><p>Still smarting from their defeat at the hands of humans centuries ago, the Kzinti, cat-like carnivores, plan their second assault on Planet Earth</p><p>Larry Niven has won the prestigious Hugo Award five times.

More than anything else, he argues, it is the neglect of consciousness that results in so much barrenness and sterility in psychology, the philosophy of mind, and cognitive science: there can be no study of mind that leaves out consciousness. What is going on in the brain is neurophysiological processes and consciousness and nothing more&#x2015;no rule following, no mental information processing or mental models, no language of thought, and no universal grammar. Mental events are themselves features of the brain, "like liquidity is a feature of water."</p><p>Beginning with a spirited discussion of what's wrong with the philosophy of mind, Searle characterizes and refutes the philosophical tradition of materialism. But he does not embrace dualism. All these "isms" are mistaken, he insists. Once you start counting types of substance you are on the wrong track, whether you stop at one or two. In four chapters that constitute the heart of his argument, Searle elaborates a theory of consciousness and its relation to our overall scientific world view and to unconscious mental phenomena. He concludes with a criticism of cognitive science and a proposal for an approach to studying the mind that emphasizes the centrality of consciousness to any account of mental functioning.</p><p>In his characteristically direct style, punctuated with persuasive examples, Searle identifies the very terminology of the field as the main source of truth. He observes that it is a mistake to suppose that the ontology of the mental is objective and to suppose that the methodology of a science of the mind must concern itself only with objectively observable behavior; that it is also a mistake to suppose that we know of the existence of mental phenomena in others only by observing their behavior; that behavior or causal relations to behavior are not essential to the existence of mental phenomena; and that it is inconsistent with what we know about the universe and our place in it to suppose that everything is knowable by us.</p></p><p>John R.

It was a weekday, and the morning began with the sun burning golden in an azure sky, but as one enthusiastic resident remarked, "The sun is always shining, and every day is beautiful in Sarasota. It took me a while to realize that I didn't have to take advantage of the days the sun shone the way I used to do in Connecticut; I could stay inside and read because there would always be another perfect day...and another...and another." </p><p> But later on this November day, clouds moved in over Sarasota. They were a peculiar leaden gray-purple shading to black, full of unpredictable electrical impulses that made one's hair stand on end. It was going to rain, but it wouldn't be a soft rain; it would surely be rain that thudded against the earth with a vengeance, forcing trees and bushes to the ground with the sheer weight of water, pounding the grass flat. </p><p> The entrance to the Gulf Gate subdivision was flanked by sweeping buff-colored brick walls bearing its name, but that was the limit of Gulf Gate's ostentation. In November the jacaranda trees planted there four decades ago were a froth of peach-colored blossoms, so lovely that they could not be real. Many of the summer flowers were faded, save some bougainvillea, and residents planted petunias and impatiens to carry them through the winter until the late summer sun's molten heat fried them. </p><p> Once a family neighborhood where children played, Gulf Gate was home now to many older couples and widows, who kept their shades drawn and hired yardmen to mow their lawns and prune their glossy-leafed trees into round orbs that looked like green plastic. Gulf Gate was close enough to Bee Ridge Road and I-75 for easy shopping and access to downtown Sarasota, but it was quiet, the streets hushed and almost free of traffic in the middle of a weekday. More often than not, there was no one walking a dog, or even peering out at the street from behind jalousie windows, those windows whose very name originates in the French word for jealousy -- "to see without being seen." But few of the residents watched from their cool rooms, because there was nothing to see outside. </p><p> One woman who lived in Gulf Gate <i>was</i> watchful, almost unconsciously moving often to the front windows of her home to scan the street for a strange vehicle or for someone she didn't recognize approaching her house. She had good reason to be leery, although she and her husband had taken every precaution to keep their address secret. </p><p> Most of the homes in Gulf Gate were owner-occupied, not lavish but very comfortable L-shaped ramblers, painted in the soft pastels of the Florida gulf coast, peach and pink and even lavender -- sunrise and sunset colors. Many had Florida rooms and swimming pools to make up for Gulf Gate's distance from Sarasota Bay. Although the neighborhood was far away from the beach, the November air was usually drenched with the salty-clean smell caught in the wind as it raced east toward the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p> <br> Much like the rest of Gulf Gate, Markridge Road was a wide, tree-lined street with single-story houses set on small, perfectly groomed lots. The white rambler with the yellow door and matching shutters in the 3100 block had once been the cherished home of an elderly couple. By 1997 they were both dead, leaving their house and its furnishings to their son. Most of the time he lived in a northern state and rented out the Markridge house. He had changed nothing; the place was frozen in a time warp with furnishings that were modern three decades earlier. "All the furniture, even the knickknacks, dated back to the sixties," one former renter recalled. "But there was a warmth about that house. Everything was still there, even their old sheet music and books, just the way they left it. We enjoyed that when we lived there." </p><p> The couches and chairs reflected the tastes of another time, but they were comfortable. The appliances were decades old too. The refrigerator was avocado green and the stove bright yellow -- but they worked. The phone bolted to the kitchen wall above the dishwasher had a rotary dial. It took a lot longer to make a call than a push-button phone, but until November 7 that was merely inconvenient and not disastrous. </p><p> <br> The young couple who moved into 3120 Markridge Road in September 1997 had the look of dependable tenants, and they seemed to be pleased with the house even though they had six children and would have to squeeze to fit everyone in. They said they'd moved from Texas when the husband got a big promotion and they needed someplace to live in a hurry. Looking at their adorable bunch of toddlers, the landlord couldn't say no to them. He decided he could forgo occupying his parents' house for one winter. </p><p> The new renters had an excellent credit history, and they were attractive. Jamie Bellush was big and burly with the wide grin and the innate charm of a seasoned salesman. His wife, Sheila, was delicately pretty, very tiny and blond. Jamie did most of the talking, while Sheila seemed a little nervous. Well, the landlord figured, she had reason to be, with all those children to care for. The toddlers were winsome and totally captivating, and it was obvious that their parents adored them. The older girls' names didn't seem to fit them. The older sister, thirteen, was called Stevie, and she hovered over the babies as if she was a second mother to them. The other sister was a year younger, and her name was Daryl. Odd. Why would anyone give boys names to two very pretty girls? </p><p> Jamie Bellush explained that they were in the process of building a much larger home in Sarasota, so they could make do in cramped quarters until their house was finished in the spring. </p><p> No one in Sarasota knew that the couple had left a dream house 1200 miles behind them in San Antonio. It had been their ideal house in a wonderful neighborhood, so large that the Markridge rental would fit inside three times over. They had barely had a chance to live in it when they felt a desperate urgency to move. And move they had, under cover of darkness. </p><p> Only a handful of people in San Antonio knew where Jamie and Sheila and their six children were. They agreed it was best to tell no one except for their closest friends and relatives, including the couple who helped them move out of Texas in the dead of night. Sheila's family knew where they were in Sarasota and had their phone number, but not their street address. Maybe in time they could come out of hiding. It hurt Jamie and Sheila not to be in contact with so many people they loved, to contemplate holidays without those who were so important to them. Cutting off her life so abruptly was akin to cutting off her arm. Sheila only hoped that everyone understood that she had no choice. </p><p> Sarasota was a beautiful place to live, and thousands of people had chosen it because of that. </p><p> There was a magical blending of sea and land, merging so easily that it was difficult to see where Sarasota Bay ended and the sandy shoreline began. All the way south from Tampa, little lakes and rivers were mirrors reflecting the blue sky, and the soaring Sunshine Bridge rose like a giant roller-coaster over Tampa Bay. But it was dark when the Bellush convoy crossed it and they hadn't realized how high they were. </p><p> Had her circumstances been different Sheila would have loved the colorful history of Sarasota and the way the city embraced the arts. She still looked forward to exploring it with her girls and the babies when things were better. Although Ringling Brothers no longer wintered there, seventeen other circuses did and many circus folk lived there permanently. Ringling Brothers had thanked Sarasota with a wonderful art museum and a college. </p><p> There were sand castle contests, blues and jazz festivals, book fairs, local dramatic productions and Broadway plays on tour and the venerable Sarasota Opera House where the great Pavarotti once performed. Every season in Sarasota was packed with all manner of celebrations. Sheila loved to read and the new Sarasota library was huge and airy and filled with sculptures and soaring mobiles. </p><p> Marina Jack's in downtown Sarasota just off Route 41 -- also known as the Tamiami Trail -- was the kind of restaurant Sheila would enjoy, with its circling staircase and magnificent water views. Someday, perhaps. For now, she and her younger children were entranced with simpler things like the tiny, tiny dust-colored lizards that darted from leaf to leaf and scuttled under bushes so quickly that they almost seemed to be figments of their imaginations. The cost of living was higher than in San Antonio; the rent on their house was a rather shocking $2300 a month. But Jamie and Sheila had chosen Sarasota because it might be a safe place to hide and, eventually, to start over. </p><p> One day they hoped to be able to be in contact with the people they loved, but for the moment they couldn't do that. They could give their address to very few people, and even <i>that</i> was a commercial mailing service, a "suite" that was really a locked mailbox in a mall. They might as well have been in a witness relocation program. Although both Sheila and Jamie came from loving, extended families, they were essentially alone. </p><p> James Joseph Bellush was an ex-marine, still saddled with his childhood nickname in his mid-thirties, although he no longer looked like a "Jamie." He looked more like a football linebacker. Jamie was a detail man -- a pharmaceutical salesman for Pfizer, and he was very good at it, an asset to the company. The very nature of his career meant that he often had to travel away from home to call on physicians in their offices along the west coast of Florida. It wasn't hard to sell Pfizer products, especially with the emergence of Viagra, but he still had to make his rounds. Jamie had been with Pfizer for a long time, and when he asked for a transfer out of San Antonio, the company accommodated him and gave him the Florida territory, a promotion. They even arranged to buy his house in Boerne, Texas, for the man who would replace him. </p><p> Sheila Bellush was thirty-five. She had worked in attorneys' offices since she was eighteen and had held an extremely responsible position in the law offices of Soules and Wallace in San Antonio for years. But now she was a full-time mom; there was no question at all of her going to work outside the home. She had more than enough to do. If she was discouraged at the prospect of fitting everyone into the Markridge house and being alone with their children while Jamie was on the road, she didn't complain. She did what she had to do, hoping always that their lives would become safer and calmer as time passed. </p><p> Sheila had no friends in Sarasota when they arrived in September, but she was working on that. She had always had friends, and it saddened her to have to leave so many behind without an explanation, although she suspected most of them knew why she had fled. Deeply religious, Sheila and Jamie were attending services at the Sarasota Baptist Church. It was a huge church with an active outreach program, and they were made welcome there. It was a start. They were rebuilding their lives, and she knew she could make new friends. </p><p> <br> And so November 7 <i>was</i> an ordinary day, but only in the context of Sheila Bellush's life. In truth there were no ordinary days for Sheila; she had lived with fear so long that it seeped like acid into any fleeting serenity she might attain, corroding her thoughts, sending jets of adrenaline through her veins. No matter how the sun shone or how balmy the winds wafting off the bay, Sheila never really felt safe unless she was inside the house with the doors and windows tightly locked against the world. Those who didn't know her well wondered if she might be just a little paranoid. Those who knew her story understood, but they were far away and didn't know how to find her. It was safer that way -- safer for them and safer for Sheila, Jamie, and their six children. </p><p> Just two months earlier Jamie and Sheila had lived in Boerne, Texas, a countrylike suburb northwest of San Antonio, where they owned their wonderful new home. Now it seemed as though they had never lived there at all. Maybe it had been too perfect to last. </p><p> But Sheila still had Jamie, and he loved her and protected her and their babies. He had begun the paperwork to adopt Stevie Leigh and Daryl Leigh, Sheila's teenage daughters by her former husband, Allen. They had their difficulties trying to get naturally rebellious teenagers and a longtime bachelor on the same wavelength, but Sheila believed things would work out. </p><p> On November 7, 1997, Jamie was on the road south of Sarasota, planning to visit several doctors' offices for Pfizer. It was important that he familiarize himself with his new territory and potential clients in west Florida. But it was Friday, and he had promised to be home long before it was dark. They would have the weekend together. Sheila had no doubt that they would spend the rest of their lives together. </p><p> She was half right. </p><p> <br> Stevie Bellush, thirteen, was petite and small-boned like her mother, although she had her father's facial features and his dark hair. It was not difficult to say where she got her superior intelligence, because both Sheila and Allen, her father, were very smart. Stevie and Daryl, who was blond like Sheila, had always excelled in school and in sports. But they had been through a lot for anyone as young as they were; their childhoods hadn't been easy. </p><p> Now Stevie was in a wonderful mood as she hurried home from junior high school shortly before 4:00 P.M. that Friday. "I heard that a boy I liked was going to ask me out," she remembered. "And I wanted to tell my mom." </p><p> The front door was unlocked, and that was strange; her mother was adamant that they all lock the doors when they left, and even when they came back in after taking the garbage out. She didn't have a lot of rules, but that was one she insisted on. So it was unusual for the front door to be unlocked. </p><p> Afterward Stevie would remember that she couldn't make sense out of the first thing she saw when she walked into the front room. All of the babies were standing in the hallway crying as if their hearts would break. Her mother never let them cry; she always picked them up and soothed them. For some reason they had no clothes on -- nothing but the little life vests they wore when they were in the swimming pool in the Florida room. Their faces were swollen from sobbing. Stevie thought they must have been crying for a long time. </p><p> What made the least sense to Stevie were the funny patterns of dark red specks on the babies' skin, some in their hair and on their feet. Some of them had swaths of the same color, as if someone had dipped a brush in red paint and then daubed at their flesh. </p><p> Shock and disbelief often block the mind from accepting what the eyes perceive. Even so, Stevie's dread was so great that there was a thunderous pounding in her ears. She patted the wailing toddlers absently and went looking for her mother, calling out for her as she moved through room after room. </p><p> Her own voice seemed to echo and bounce...</p></p><h2>Growing Artists: Teaching the Arts to Young Children</h2><p>GROWING ARTISTS: TEACHING THE ARTS TO YOUNG CHILDREN, 6th Edition, provides early childhood educators with the theoretical framework and background knowledge needed to design creative arts activities for young children from infancy through the primary grades.

It's concise but thorough, crisply written, meticulous and very readable. It should find a wide audience." --Larry McMurtry, author of Sin Killer and the Pulitzer Prize winning Lonesome Dove</p>It&#x2019;s the stuff of tall tales, legends, and epic films like Red River and Giant. King Ranch, carved from the scrub and mesquite of the South Texas coastal plains and comprising more acreage than the state of Rhode Island, is the largest and most famous cattle ranch in American history. From cattle empire to oil empire to multilayered, media-shy corporation beset by legal battles and power struggles, King Ranch embodies the oldest dream of American wealth&#x2013;the possession of land and the perpetuation of a dynasty.<p>Kings of Texas is the sprawling saga of the larger-than-life characters who founded, built, and expanded this vast holding. Renowned Texas scholar, writer, and storyteller Don Graham weaves a compelling multigenerational family drama into the complex social history of South Texas. The result is an intricate tapestry laced with thrilling tales drawn from decades of conflict arising from the Mexican War, the Civil War, and countless skirmishes between Texas Rangers and border bandits. It was the era, too, when great herds of longhorns were sent north up the Chisholm Trail. And all the while, King Ranch was expanding, growing ever more powerful and famous in the land. </p><p>You&#x2019;ll meet the man who started it all&#x2013;Richard King, the orphaned son of Irish immigrants who founded a dynasty in the middle of "heartbreak country," and who believed firmly in the dictum of his friend, Robert E. Lee&#x2013;Buy land and never sell. You&#x2019;ll follow King&#x2019;s rise from riverboat pilot to rancher, his courtship of the daughter of a dour Presbyterian preacher, and his creation of an American version of a Spanish hacienda, sustaining generations of work and loyalty from Mexican vaqueros and their families, who became known as the Kine�os, King&#x2019;s people. And always, there were the struggles to acquire more land and to protect his holdings from cattle thieves, raiders, and, most threatening of all, lawsuits. </p><p>You&#x2019;ll also meet a smart, ambitious young lawyer named Robert J. Kleberg, whose legal maneuverings protected King from a judgment won by Kleberg&#x2019;s own client&#x2013;the J. R. Ewing moment in this narrative. Kleberg then courted and married King&#x2019;s daughter, Alice, and became patriarch of King Ranch after its founder&#x2019;s death. Kleberg and King&#x2019;s actions, however, would come back to haunt their descendants more than a century later, striking at the very heart of their empire.</p><p>The Ranch&#x2019;s modern history begins with Bob Kleberg Jr., "a tornado of a man," who pushed the Ranch to stunning new levels of success. He expanded its holdings, produced the only new breed of cattle ever created in the new world, and developed a Triple Crown&#x2014;winning racehorse. Hardworking, hardriding, and harddrinking, he made millions from oil leases and, with the help of his wife, Helen, took the Ranch global with operations in Cuba, South America, and Australia. His death in 1974 led to a troubled succession and, in 1998, Stephen J. ("Tio") Kleberg, the last of his family to run King Ranch, was fired in favor of a CEO with offices in Houston.</p><p>From humble frontier jacales to the sleek offices of a multinational corporation, Kings of Texas tells an unforgettable story of vision and violence; generosity and greed; loyalty and betrayal, set on a stage as vast as the American dream.</p></p><h2>Waste Away: Working and Living with a North American Landfill</h2><p>Though we are the most wasteful people in the history of the world, very few of us know what becomes of our waste. In <i>Waste Away</i>, Joshua O. Reno reveals how North Americans have been shaped by their preferred means of disposal: sanitary landfill. Based on the author&#x2019;s fieldwork as a common laborer at a large, transnational landfill on the outskirts of Detroit, the book argues that waste management helps our possessions and dwellings to last by removing the transient materials they shed and sending them elsewhere.&nbsp; Ethnography conducted with waste workers shows how they conceal and contain other people&#x2019;s wastes, all while negotiating the filth of their occupation, holding on to middle-class aspirations, and occasionally scavenging worthwhile stuff from the trash. <i>Waste Away</i> also traces the circumstances that led one community to host two landfills and made Michigan a leading importer of foreign waste. Focusing on local activists opposed to the transnational waste trade with Canada, the book&#x2019;s ethnography analyzes their attempts to politicize the removal of waste out of sight that many take for granted. Documenting these different ways of relating to the management of North American rubbish, <i>Waste Away </i>demonstrates how the landfills we create remake us in turn, often behind our backs and beneath our notice.</p><p>"Waste management in industrial society is designed to be out of sight and out of mind. Joshua O. Reno's vivid account of work on a Michigan landfill illustrates the human consequences of disposal in North America.&nbsp;<i>Waste Away</i>&nbsp;is a valuable contribution to our understanding of discards and the people who work with discarded materials."&#x2014;Carl A. Zimring, Associate Professor of Sustainability Studies, Pratt Institute<br> "Can waste exhilarate and mortify simultaneously? Can it make you draw closer even while cringing? Joshua O. Reno brings all the dynamism of trash&#x2014;too often denied or disavowed&#x2014;into view. He lucidly shifts waste from an afterthought to a front-and-center cultural artifact that explains us all too well."&#x2014;John Hartigan, Professor of Anthropology and Director of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Am�rico&nbsp;Paredes Center for Cultural Studies, University of Texas, Austin<b>Joshua O. Reno</b> is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Binghamton University.</p><h2>A History of the Middle Ages, 300&#x2013;1500</h2><p>This clear and comprehensive text covers the Middle Ages from the classical era to the late medieval period. Distinguished historian John Riddle provides a cogent analysis of the rulers, wars, and events&#x2014;both natural and human&#x2014;that defined the medieval era. Taking a broad geographical perspective, Riddle includes northern and eastern Europe, Byzantine civilization, and the Islamic states. Each, he convincingly shows, offered values and institutions&#x2014;religious devotion, toleration and intolerance, laws, ways of thinking, and changing roles of women&#x2014;that presaged modernity. In addition to traditional topics of pen, sword, and word, the author explores other driving forces such as science, religion, and technology in ways that previous textbooks have not. He also examines such often-overlooked issues as medieval gender roles and medicine and seminal events such as the crusades from the vantage point of both Muslims and eastern and western Christians.<br><br>In addition to a thorough chronological narrative, the text offers humanizing features to engage students. Each chapter opens with a theme-setting vignette about the lives of ordinary and extraordinary people. The book also introduces students to key controversies and themes in historiography by featuring in each chapter a prominent medieval historian and how his or her ideas have shaped contemporary thinking about the Middle Ages.

I love it precisely because it is beautiful, because it is rich - because, I think, it brings joy to my heart. . .</strong><br><br>On Christmas day, in the flurry of a snow storm, the Huberts discover a ragged nine year old girl sheltering under the neighbouring cathedral porch. Childless and pious, the couple take in and raise Angelique as their own. The girl is intensely passionate, and given to rage and disobedience as well as love and religious fervour. Inspired by <em>The Golden Legend</em>, Angelique creates a dream world all of her own, peopled with spirits. As part of her dream vision, she becomes convinced she will marry a rich and handsome young prince. Her wish seemingly comes true when she falls in love with a lord's son...<br><br>The sixteenth novel in the Rougon-Macquart series, <em>The Dream</em> marks a departure by Zola from the conventions of realism. Here, Zola explores the persistence of mysticism, but also blends elements of fairy tale with the naturalist techniques for which he had become known.

Second, Ad Age provides a lot of up-to-date information about advertising that would be out dated by the time it was printed in a textbook.

But he uses means. He uses God-centered traditions and Bible-saturated family patterns and grace-laden heirlooms. Only God can give our children a taste for the sweetness of God. Only God can awaken them to his worth. But year in and year out there are traditions that show children that God is our Treasure.</p> <p>No�l Piper opens her home to you&#x2014;more than thirty years of marriage and mothering. She invites you into the happy, imperfect Piper pattern of life (including a few family-occasion poems written by her husband, John). But, even better, she roots things in the Bible.</p> <p>God-treasuring traditions can be ordinary, everyday habits such as telling stories, attending church, and using affectionate nicknames. They may be rare &#x201c;especially&#x201d; occasions such as funerals and weddings. And they are the creative ways we reflect Christ in our holidays.</p> <p>No�l Piper believes that by our traditions we can help the next generation treasure God, and at the same time deepen our own love for him. Like a scribe trained for the kingdom of heaven, she brings out of her treasure what is new and what is old&#x2014;making the old new and rooting the new in the old. In this way, the next generation absorbs the truth that the treasure we have in God is ancient in wisdom and strength, and fresh as the morning dew. No�l loves making children (and adults) bow their heads with reverence and clap their hands with joy.</p> <p>"God created us for His glory&#x2014;and gave us a character that craves traditions. Nevertheless, the frantic pace and highly mobile nature of our society rob many families of any sense of tradition&#x2014;and any cherished traditions of their own. No�l Piper understands the traditions of the Christian faith and their importance to family and church life. Treasuring God in Our Traditions is a much needed corrective and a wonderful gift to Christians in this age. We must recover a biblical affirmation of faithful traditions in this generation, for God's glory and our joy."<br> Al and Mary Mohler</p> <p>&#x201c;No�l Piper offers Christian parents uncommon wisdom and hope in her Treasuring God in Our Traditions. Her vision for a God-centered home and family is both biblical and inspiring, and her many ideas and suggestions (including activities and recipes) offer much food for reflection and application. This parenting guidebook is at once motivational, instructive, practical, and based on a deep and beautiful vision of God.&#x201d;<br> Bruce and Jodi Ware</p> <p>&#x201c;As Christians we long to pass on the faith to the next generation. In this amazingly practical book No�l Piper gets right to the heart of what we need to pass onto our children and grandchildren. Sometimes we think that being God-centered means that we always live spontaneously. This book reminds us that traditions and patterns woven into the fabric of everyday life can cultivate love for God.&#x201d;<br> Tom and Diane Schreiner</p> <p>&#x201c;Treasuring God in Our Traditions offers the reader an intimate glimpse into a remarkable Christian family. This book will lead you and your loved ones to the Ultimate Treasure.

Charles Freeman&#x2019;s meticulous historical account of Christianity from its birth in Judaea in the first century A.D. to the emergence of Western and Eastern churches by A.D. 600 reveals that it was a distinctive, vibrant, and incredibly diverse movement brought into order at the cost of intellectual and spiritual vitality. Against the conventional narrative of the inevitable &#x201c;triumph&#x201d; of a single distinct Christianity, Freeman shows that there was a host of competing Christianities, many of which had as much claim to authenticity as those that eventually dominated. Looking with fresh eyes at the historical record, Freeman explores the ambiguities and contradictions that underlay Christian theology and the unavoidable compromises enforced in the name of doctrine.</p><p>Tracing the astonishing transformation that the early Christian church underwent&#x2014;from sporadic niches of Christian communities surviving in the wake of a horrific crucifixion to sanctioned alliance with the state&#x2014;Charles Freeman shows how freedom of thought was curtailed by the development of the concept of faith. The imposition of "correct belief," religious uniformity, and an institutional framework that enforced orthodoxy were both consolidating and stifling. Uncovering the difficulties in establishing the Christian church, he examines its relationship with Judaism, Gnosticism, Greek philosophy and Greco-Roman society, and he offers dramatic new accounts of Paul, the resurrection, and the church fathers and emperors.</p></p><p><b>Charles Freeman</b> is a specialist on the ancient world and its legacy.

He lives in the UK."<i>A History of Early Christianity</i> is a masterful book, and a pleasure to read. Freeman narrates the development, diversity, and spread of Christianity with originality and verve. It is a story that brims over with fascinating accounts, intriguing quotations from figures in the ancient Mediterranean, and illuminating historical analysis. It is also a crucial resource for our understanding of ongoing cultural negotiations of religious and political spheres, all those theologico-political paradoxes that face us now more than ever. I do not think there exists a more engaging and illuminating history of early Christianity than this one."&#x2014;Ward Blanton, University of Glasgow<br> (Ward Blanton)<br><br>"Even those who are adherents to Christianity may be puzzled by the tensions which exist in its primary sources, and this meticulous attempt to probe its origins and development is to be welcomed. Charles Freeman embraces the different kinds of approaches and positions which are found in the ancient texts, Christian and otherwise, painting a vivid picture of the nature of Christianity in all its diversity in the earliest centuries of its existence."&#x2014;Christopher Rowland, author of <i>Christian Origins<br></i> <br><br> (Christopher Rowland)<br><br> "This is a bold and imaginative historical synthesis which fills an important need.

It is a monumental contribution. Nothing of this scope exists in the Western literature of this field, with the possible exception of Ajuriaguerra and Hecaen&#39;s book (in French) on the cerebral cortex. Professor Luria&#39;s book thus marks a further and decisive step toward the eventual coalescence of neurology and psychology, a goal to which only a few laboratories in the East and West have been devoted over the last decades. The book is unique in its organization. The first half deals with observations and interpretations concerning the major syndromes of man&#39;s left cerebral hemisphere: those grievous distortions of higher functions traditionally described as aphasia, agnosia, and apraxia. There is also a detailed and brilliant analysis of the syndrome of massive frontal-lobe involvement. The entire second half of the book is given over to a painstaking description of Professor Luria&#39;s tests, many of them introduced by himself, and set out in such detail that anyone could repeat them and thus verify Professor Luria&#39;s interpretations.</p><p>Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>The Handbook of Community Practice</h2><p><p>The<b> Second Edition </b>of <b>The Handbook of Community Practice </b>is expanded and updated with a major global focus and serves as a comprehensive guidebook of community practice grounded in social justice and human rights.

It was written in the conviction that more reflective, theoretical discussion is needed to guide the gathering of facts that the diagnosis of troubles. This subject, like the larger study of government and society, requires our profoundest intellectual concern. We shall not find any simple prescriptions for sound organizational leadership; nor will it be purchased with a bag of tricks and gadgets. It requires nothing less than the proper ordering of human affairs, including the establishment of social order, the determination of public interest, and the defense of critical values. Thus conceived, our inquiry has ancient roots. The main problems and issues have been known for a long time, although they need to be restated for the purposes of administrative theory.</p><p>"Philip Selznick has profoundly affected how all serious students of organizations think about their subject. <i>Leadership in Administration</i> is, perhaps, his masterpiece: a lucid, rigorous, yet humane analysis of the essential task of leadership that brilliantly reaffirms the organic, value-infused character of a successful enterprise, whether private or public. The central concepts of the book&#x2015;'mission,' 'distinctive competence'&#x2015;have become so much a part of our vocabulary that we sometimes forget they had to be invented and that Selznick invented them. His reminder that the true exercise of leadership transcends a concern with mere efficiency is even more appropriate in today's era of quasi-scientific thought about organizations than it was when, presciently, he first set it forth in 1957."&#x2015;James Q. Wilson, Harvard University<br><br>"The reappearance of <i>Leadership in Administration</i> will be most welcome to students of organizations because it provides the most lucid and complete statement available of Selznick's special view of organizations. This view has given rise to the institutionalist school of organizational analysis, one of the liveliest and more irrelevant alternatives to mainstream rationalist formulations."&#x2015;W. Richard Scott, Stanford University<br><br>"<i>Leadership in Administration</i> has become a classic in the art of executive leadership. In fact, it is stimulating more managerial thought and organizational research today than ever before."&#x2015;Robert H.

Originally published in England in the spring of 1944&#x2014;when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the socialist program&#x2014;<i>The Road to Serfdom</i> was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of nazi Germany and fascist Italy.<br><br>First published by the University of Chicago Press on September 18, 1944, <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> garnered immediate attention from the public, politicians, and scholars alike. The first printing of 2,000 copies was exhausted instantly, and within six months more than 30,000 were sold. In April of 1945, <i>Reader's Digest</i> published a condensed version of the book, and soon thereafter the Book-of-the-Month Club distributed this condensation to more than 600,000 readers. A perennial best-seller, the book has sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States, not including the British edition or the nearly twenty translations into such languages as German, French, Dutch, Swedish, and Japanese, and not to mention the many underground editions produced in Eastern Europe before the fall of the iron curtain.<br><br>After thirty-two printings in the United States, <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> has established itself alongside the works of Alexis de Tocqueville, John Stuart Mill, and George Orwell for its timeless meditation on the relation between individual liberty and government authority. This fiftieth anniversary edition, with a new introduction by Milton Friedman, commemorates the enduring influence of <i>The Road to Serfdom</i> on the ever-changing political and social climates of the twentieth century, from the rise of socialism after World War II to the Reagan and Thatcher "revolutions" in the 1980s and the transitions in Eastern Europe from communism to capitalism in the 1990s.<br><br>F.

Lovecraft to Guillermo Del Toro and it remains no less unsettling today.<br><br>This new collection, which includes the complete novel <em>The Three Impostors</em> as well as such celebrated tales as <em>The Great God Pan</em> and <em>The White People</em>, constitutes the most comprehensive critical edition of Machen yet to appear. In addition to the core late Victorian horror classics, a selection of lesser known prose poems and later tales helps to present a fuller picture of the development of Machen's weird vision. The edition's introduction and notes contextualize the life and work of this foundational figure in the history of horror.<br></p><p><br><strong>Arthur Machen</strong> is a significant figure in supernatural literature of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. His work, which mixes Gothic horror with fin-de-siecle mysticism, has influenced writers and film-makers (notably H. P. Lovecraft, Jorge Luis Borges, Stephen King, and Alan Moore). From the beginning of his literary career, Machen espoused a mystical belief that the humdrum ordinary world hid a more mysterious and strange world beyond. His gothic and decadent works of the 1890s concluded that the lifting of this veil could lead to madness, sex, or death, and usually a combination of all three. Machen's later works became somewhat less obviously full of gothic trappings, but for him investigations into mysteries invariably resulted in life-changing transformation and sacrifice. <br><br><strong>Aaron Worth</strong> is Associate Professor of Rhetoric at Boston University, having previously taught courses in English and American literature at Brandeis University.

But he keeps us constantly on guard against generalization and clich�. Cherished concepts like Romanticism, tradition, nationalism vs. universality, the musical culture of the bourgeoisie, are put to pointed reevaluation. Always demonstrating the interest in socio-historical influences that is the hallmark of his work, Dahlhaus reminds us of the contradictions, interrelationships, psychological nuances, and riches of musical character and musical life.<br><br><i>Nineteenth-Century Music</i> contains 90 illustrations, the collected captions of which come close to providing a summary of the work and the author's methods. Technical language is kept to a minimum, but while remaining accessible, Dahlhaus challenges, braces, and excites. This is a landmark study that no one seriously interested in music and nineteenth-century European culture will be able to ignore.</p><p><b>Carl Dahlhaus </b> was, at the time of his death in 1989, Professor of Music at Technische Universit�t Berlin.&#34;Dahlhaus is frequently illuminating about major figures who have found less fame with posterity. . . .

One of Cather&#39;s later works.</p><p>Willa Cather was born near Winchester, Virginia, in 1873. When she was ten years old, her family moved to the prairies of Nebraska, later the setting for a number of her novels. At the age of twenty-one, she graduated from the University of Nebraska, and she spent the next few years doing newspaper work and teaching high school in Pittsburgh. In 1903, her first book, <i>April Twilights, </i>a collection of poems, was published, and two years later <i>The Troll Garden, </i>a collection of stories, appeared in print. After the publication of her first novel, <i>Alexander&#x2019;s Bridge, </i>in 1912, Cather devoted herself full time to writing, and over the years she completed eleven more novels (including <i>O Pioneers!, My �ntonia, The Professor&#x2019;s House, </i>and <i>Death Comes for the Archbishop</i>), four collections of short stories, and two volumes of essays. Cather won the Pulitzer Prize for <i>One of Ours </i>in 1923. She died in 1947.<i>Book I<br><br></i>I<br><br><i>The Breakfast Table, 1856.<br><br></i>Henry Colbert, the miller, always breakfasted with his wife &#x2014; beyond that he appeared irregularly at the family table. At noon, the dinner hour, he was often detained down at the mill. His place was set for him; he might come, or he might send one of the mill-hands to bring him a tray from the kitchen. The Mistress was served promptly. She never questioned as to his whereabouts.<br><br>On this morning in March 1856, he walked into the dining-room at eight o'clock, &#x2014;came up from the mill, where he had been stirring about for two hours or more. He wished his wife good-morning, expressed the hope that she had slept well, and took his seat in the high-backed armchair opposite her. His breakfast was brought in by an old, white-haired coloured man in a striped cotton coat. The Mistress drew the coffee from a silver coffee urn which stood on four curved legs. The china was of good quality (as were all the Mistress's things); surprisingly good to find on the table of a country miller in the Virginia backwoods. Neither the miller nor his wife was native here: they had come from a much richer county, east of the Blue Ridge. They were a strange couple to be found on Back Creek, though they had lived here now for more than thirty years. <br><br>The miller was a solid, powerful figure of a man, in whom height and weight agreed. His thick black hair was still damp from the washing he had given his face and head before he came up to the house; it stood up straight and busy because he had run his fingers through it. His face was full, square, and distinctly florid; a heavy coat of tan made it a reddish brown, like an old port. He was clean-shaven, &#x2014;unusual in a man of his age and station. His excuse was that a miller's beard got powdered with flour-dust, and when the sweat ran down his face this flour got wet and left him with a bear full of dough. His countenance bespoke a man of upright character, straightforward and determined. It was only his eyes that were puzzling; dark and grave, set far back under a square, heavy brow. Those eyes, reflective, almost dreamy, seemed out of keeping with the simple vigour of his face. The long lashes would have been a charm in a woman.<br><br>Colbert drove his mill hard, gave it his life, indeed. He was noted for fair dealing, and was trusted in a community to which he had come a stranger. Trusted, but scarcely liked. The people of Back Creek and Timber Ridge and Hayfield never forgot that he was not one of themselves. He was silent and uncommunicative (a trait they didn't like), and his lack of a Southern accent amounted almost to a foreign accent. His grandfather had come over from Flanders. Henry was born in Loudoun County and had grown up in a neighbourhood of English settlers. He spoke the language as they did, spoke it clearly and decidedly. This was not, on Back Creek, a friendly way of talking.<br><br>His wife also spoke differently from the Back Creek people; but they admitted that a woman and an heiress had a right to. Her mother had come out from England &#x2014; a fact she never forgot. How these two came to be living at the Mill Farm is a long story &#x2014; too long for a breakfast-table story.<br><br>The miller drank his first cup of coffee in silence. The old black man stood behind the Mistress's chair.<br><br>"You may go, Washington," she said presently. While she drew another cup of coffee from the urn with her very plump white hands, she addressed her husband: "Major Grimwood stopped by yesterday, on his way to Romney. You should have come up to see him."<br><br>"I couldn't leave the mill just then. I had customers who had come a long way for their grain," he replied gravely.<br><br>"If you had a foreman, as everyone else has, you would have time to be civil to important visitors."<br><br>"And neglect my business? Yes, Sapphira, I know all about these foremen. That is how it is done back in Loudoun County. The boss tells the foreman, and the foreman tells the head nigger, and the head nigger passes it on. I am the first miller who has ever made a living in these parts."<br><br>"A poor one at that, we must own," said his wife with an indulgent chuckle. "And speaking of niggers, Major Grimwood tells me his wife is in need of a handy girl just now. He knows my servants are well trained, and would like to have one of them."<br><br>"He must know you train your servants for your own use. We don't sell our people. You might ring for some more bacon. I seem to feel hungry this morning."<br><br>She rang a little clapper bell. Washington brought the bacon and again took his place behind his mistress's large, cumbersome chair. She had been sitting in a muse while he served. Now, without speaking to him, she put out her plump hand in the direction of the door. The old man scuttled off in his flapping slippers.<br><br>"Of course we don't sell our people," she agreed mildly. "Certainly we would never <i>offer</i> any for sale. But to oblige friends is a different matter. And you've often said you don't want to stand in anybody's way. To live in Winchester, in a mansion like the Grimwoods' &#x2014;any darky would jump at the chance."<br><br>"We have none to spare, except such as Major Grimwood wouldn't want. I will tell him so."<br><br>Mrs. Colbert went on in her bland, considerate voice: "There is my Nancy, now. I could spare her quite well to oblige Mrs. Grimwood, and she could hardly find a better place. It would be a fine opportunity for her."<br><br>The miller flushed a deep red up to the roots of his thick hair. His eyes seemed to sink farther back under his heavy brow as he looked directly at his wife. His look seemed to say: <i>I see through all this, see to the bottom</i>. She did not meet his glance. She was gazing thoughtfully at the coffee urn.<br><br>Her husband pushed back his plate. "Nancy least of all! Her mother is here, and old Jezebel. Her people have been in your family for four generations. You haven't trained Nancy for Mrs. Grimwood. She stays here."<br><br>The icy quality, so effective with her servants, came into Mrs. Colbert's voice as she answered him.<br><br>"It's nothing to get flustered about, Henry. As you say, her mother and grandmother were all Dodderidge niggers. So it seems to me I ought to be allowed to arrange Nancy's future. Her mother would approve. She knows that a proper lady's maid can never be trained out here in this rough country."<br><br>The miller's frown darkened. "You can't sell her without my name to the deed of sale, and I will never put it there. You never seemed to understand how, when we first moved up here, your troop of niggers was held against us. This isn't a slave-owning neighbourhood. If you sold a good girl like Nancy off to Winchester, people hereabouts would hold it against you. They would say hard things."<br><br>Mrs. Colbert's small mouth twisted. She gave her husband an arch, tolerant smile. "They have talked before, and we've survived. They surely talked when black Till bore a yellow child, after two of your brothers had been hanging round here so much. Some fixed it on Jacob, and some on Guy. Perhaps you have a kind of family feeling about Nancy?"<br><br>"You know well enough, Sapphira, it was that painter from Baltimore."<br><br>"Perhaps. We got portraits out of him, anyway, and maybe we got a smart yellow girl into the bargain." Mrs. Colbert laughed discreetly, as if the idea amused her and rather pleased her. "Till was within her rights, seeing she had to live with old Jeff. I never hectored her about it."<br><br>The miller rose and walked toward the door.<br><br>"One moment, Henry." As he turned, she beckoned him back. "You don't really mean you will not allow me to dispose of one of my own servants? You signed when Tom and Jake and Ginny and the others went back."<br><br>"Yes, because they were going back among their own kin, and to the country they were born in. But I'll never sign for Nancy."<br><br>Mrs. Colbert's pale-blue eyes followed her husband as he went out of the door. Her small mouth twisted mockingly. "Then we must find some other way," she said softly to herself.<br><br>Presently she rang for old Washington. When he came she said nothing, being lost in thought, but put her hands on the arms of the square, high-backed chair in which she sat. The old man ran to open two doors. Then he drew his mistress's chair away from the table, picked up a cushion on which her feet had been resting, tucked it under his arm, and gravely wheeled the chair, which proved to be on castors, out of the dining-room, down the long hall, and into Mrs. Colbert's bedchamber.<br><br>The Mistress ahd dropsy and was unable to walk. She could still stand erect to receive visitors: her dresses touched the floor and concealed the deformity of her feet and ankles. She was four years older than her husband &#x2014; and hated it. This dropsical affliction was all the more cruel in that she had been a very active woman, and had managed the farm as zealously as her husband managed his mill.</p><h2>Horngren's Financial &amp; Managerial Accounting</h2><p><i>For courses in Financial and Managerial Accounting.</i> <p> <i> <br> </i> </p> <p> <b>Expanding on proven success with Horngren's financial and managerial accounting</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Horngren&#x2019;s Financial and Managerial Accounting</i> </b> presents the core content of principles of accounting in a fresh format designed to help today&#x2019;s learners succeed.

His many and varied writings largely respond to the specific challenges he faced throughout his life, and they show his evolving ideas, as well as his deepening spirituality and humanity, over several decades. Drawn from the full range of Gandhi's published work--books, articles, broadcasts, interviews, letters--this superb selection illuminates his thinking on religion and spirituality, on society and its problems, on politics and British rule, and on non-violence and civil disobedience. The pieces are arranged to underscore Gandhi's belief that transformation in human life should be from the roots upwards, from the individual through to social and political relations. The Introduction by Judith Brown--a leading authority on Gandhi--provides a succinct account of his life and his ambiguous role in the Indian nationalist movement, examines what kind of thinker and writer Gandhi was, and shows how he built a coherent body of thought.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Attitude</b>, Jeffrey Gitomer's <b>The Little Green Book of Getting Your Way&nbsp;</b>digs deep into the 9.5 elements that make persuasion, and getting your way, happen. By breaking down the elements, the reader will begin to understand, take action, become proficient, and then master the ability to persuade. Because persuasion occurs in so many different areas of life and business, Gitomer leads the reader from mental readiness to the principles of getting your way and the power that persuasion offers. He challenges the reader to prepare before they present, to prepare before they try to persuade. He demonstrates how to change a presentation into a performance and shows how this can be done in any environment. But because persuasion most often takes place in business, he draws special emphasis to the reader's ability to write and sell persuasively. The book talks about the persistence that enables winning persuasion. He brings the Benjamin Franklin quote "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" to the Gitomer level of "You only fail when you decide to quit," and the book ends challenging the reader how to think about excellence and eloquence. It will be up to the reader to take advantage of the opportunity and harness the power.</p><p><b>Jeffrey Gitomer</b> is the world's #1 expert on selling.

Comparing Vittorini's work to Picasso's, Italo Calvino described Conversations as "the book-Guernica."<br><br> The novel begins at a time in the narrator's life when nothing seems to matter; whether he is reading newspaper posters blaring of wartime massacres, lying in bed with his wife or girlfriend, or flipping through the pages of a dictionary it is all the same to him&#x2015;until he embarks on a journey back to Sicily, the home he has not seen in some fifteen years.

Eliot</p><h2>The Voyage Out</h2><p>The Modern Library is proud to include Virginia Woolf's first novel, <b>The Voyage Out</b>--together with a new Introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Cunningham. Published to acclaim in England in 1915 and in America five years later, <b>The Voyage Out</b> marks Woolf's beginning as one of the twentieth century's most brilliant and prolific writers.<br><br>Less formally experimental than her later novels, <b>The Voyage Out</b> none-theless clearly lays bare the poetic style and innovative technique--with its multiple figures of consciousness, its detailed portraits of characters' inner lives, and its constant shifting between the quotidian and the profound--that are the signature of Woolf's fiction. <br><br>Rachel Vinrace, Woolf's first heroine, is a motherless young woman who, at twenty-four, embarks on a sea voyage with a party of other English folk to South America. Guileless, and with only a smattering of education, Rachel is taken under the wing of her aunt Helen, who desires to teach Rachel "how to live."Arriving in Santa Marina, a village on the South American coast, Rachel and Helen are introduced to a group of English expatriates. Among them is the young, sensitive Terence Hewet, an aspiring writer, with whom Rachel falls in love. But theirs is ultimately a tale of doomed love, set against a chorus of other stories and other points of view, as the narrative shifts focus between its central and peripheral characters. E. M. Forster praised <b>The Voyage Out</b> as "a book which attains unity as surely as <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, though by a different path."<br><br>This edition includes a new Introduction by Michael Cunningham, bestselling author of <i>The Hours</i>. Cunningham at once unfolds an engaging short essay of Woolf's early life and career, an insightful exploration of the themes to which Woolf returns again and again in her fiction, and a spirited defense of the relevance and lasting importance of her art. Katherine Anne Porter wrote of Woolf: "The world of arts was her native territory; she ranged freely under her own sky, speaking her mother tongue fearlessly."</p><p>The Voyage Out (1915) is the story of a rite of passage. When Rachel Vinrace embarks for South America on her father&#39;s ship she is launched on a course of self-discovery in a modern version of the mythic voyage. Virginia Woolf knew all too well the forms that she was supposed to follow when writing of a young lady&#39;s entrance into the world, and she struggled to subvert the conventions, wittily and assiduously, rewriting and revising the novel many times. The finished work is not, on the face of it, a &#39;portrait of the artist&#39;. However, through The Voyage Out readers discover Woolf as an emerging and original artist: not identified with the heroine, but present everywhere in the social satire, the lyricism, and the patterning of consciousness.Michael Cunningham's novel <b>The Hours</b> won the 1999 PEN/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize. His other novels include <b>A Home at the End of the World</b> and <b>Blood</b>. He lives in New York City.</p><h2>Theurgy and the Soul: The Neoplatonism of Iamblichus (2nd edition)</h2><p>Theurgy and the Soul is a study of Iamblichus of Syria (ca. 240&#x2013;325), whose teachings set the final form of pagan spirituality prior to the Christianization of the Roman Empire. Gregory Shaw focuses on the theory and practice of theurgy, a term meaning &#x201c;divine action,&#x201d; the most controversial and significant aspect of Iamblichus&#x2019;s Platonism. Unlike previous Platonists, who stressed the elevated status of the human soul, Iamblichus taught that the soul descends completely into the body and requires the performance of theurgic rites&#x2014;-revealed by the gods--to unite the soul with the One. Iamblichus was a seminal Platonic philosopher whose views on the soul and the importance of ritual profoundly influenced subsequent thinkers such as Proclus, Damascius, and Dionysius the Areopagite. Iamblichus&#x2019;s vision of a hierarchical cosmos united by divine ritual became the dominant worldview for the entire medieval world, and played an important role in the Renaissance Platonism of Marsilio Ficino. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that he expected a reading of Iamblichus to cause a &#x201c;revival in the churches.&#x201d; Yet, until recently, modern scholars have dismissed him, seeing theurgy as ritual magic or an attempt to manipulate the gods. Shaw, however, shows that theurgy was a subtle and intellectually sophisticated attempt to apply Platonic and Pythagorean teachings to the full expression of human existence in the material world. This new edition includes a foreword by John Milbank and Aaron Riches showing the Christian sacramental implications of Iamblichean theurgy, and a new preface from the author.</p><p>"<i>Theurgy and the Soul</i> remains the one essential work not only on the mysterious yet influential figure of Iamblichus, but also on the emergence of religious or theurgical Neoplatonism. Shaw presents the reasoning and classical pedigree behind the sometimes obscure doctrines and practices belonging to this often misunderstood school of thought. His analysis reveals it as a dynamic and distinct form of philosophy in its own right, and not the last gasp of Hellenism before the onset of the Middle Ages."<br> --<b>L. MICHAEL HARRINGTON</b>, author of <i>Sacred Place in Early Medieval Neoplatonism</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Gregory Shaw's <i>Theurgy and the Soul</i> is the essential guide for those seeking entry to the experiential dimension of late Neoplatonism. The book is also philosophically sound, but its primary importance lies in bringing alive for sympathetic readers the symbolic and imaginal realities that animated the spiritual practices of Iamblichus and his followers. It reveals Late Antique Platonists clearly as mystical existentialists whose teachings are just as vital now as they were in antiquity." <br> --<b>JOHN BUSSANICH</b>, author of&nbsp;<i>The One and Its Relation to Intellect in Plotinus</i>Gregory Shaw is Professor of Religious Studies at Stonehill College, Massachusetts, and the author of articles on the later Neoplatonists and Iamblichus in particular. He is currently working on a manuscript that explores the embodied aspects of later Platonic philosophy and its similarity to tantric traditions of South Asia and other non-dual religious traditions.</p><h2>Les Jeux Sont Faits (Fiction, Poetry &amp; Drama) (French Edition)</h2><p>A penetrating introductory discussion of Sartre&#39;s philosophy as it is illustrated in his plays and novels.</p><p></p><h2>Major Problems in the History of the Vietnam War: Documents and Essays (Major Problems in American History Series)</h2><p>Designed to encourage critical thinking about history, the Major Problems in American History series introduces students to both primary sources and analytical essays on important topics in U.S. history.

His explorations of Hollywood's stars, directors, and most famous films&#x2015;as well as his fresh look at Godard, Bergman, and other great European directors&#x2015;will be of lasting interest to movie-viewers and intelligent people everywhere.</p><p>Stanley Cavell was Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Emeritus, at Harvard University.&#x201c;Perhaps more than in any other country, film studies in the United States have been hampered by a tradition of casual reporting and a smuggish academic refusal to allow a mass entertainment art any serious intellectual status. Stanley Cavell&#x2019;s <i>The World Viewed</i> is an important a valuable counter to this tradition and its journalistic judgments... As a philosopher of art, Cavell is clearly not only a rigorous thinker but an imaginative one who can convincingly integrate phenomenological concepts into film studies or translate figures from Baudelaire&#x2019;s <i>Painter of Modern Life</i> into illuminating categories of film analysis.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Timothy Corrigan</b><b>, </b><b><i>Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to think of Stanley Cavell&#x2019;s <i>The World Viewed</i> as simply a film book... Cavell&#x2019;s book is about films...at a thoroughly engaged level of reflection... It does not move one to rush to the nearest movie theater for a new immersion in films; rather, it prompts one to reexamine one&#x2019;s own past experiences of films... With Cavell the sense of the claims which movies make upon us is intense. He does not linger over any particular one, in a spirit of impatience roughly analogous to the one which prompted T. S. Eliot to say the &#x2018;The poetry does not matter.&#x2019; The poetry does not matter, poetry matters.

As a primer, it provides a clear tutorial approach to the language, enhanced by numerous examples and other learning aids. Unlike most primers, it also provides a detailed description of the language, with particular emphasis on current and effective programming techniques.</p> <p>Countless programmers have used previous editions of <i>C++ Primer</i> to learn C++. In that time C++ has matured greatly. Over the years, the focus of the language--and of C++ programmers--has grown beyond a concentration on runtime efficiency to focus on ways of making <i>programmers</i> more efficient. With the widespread availability of the standard library, it is possible to use and learn C++ more effectively than in the past. This revision of the <i>C++ Primer</i> reflects these new possiblities.</p> <p><b>Changes to the Fourth Edition</b></p> <p>In this edition, we have completely reorganized and rewritten the <i>C++ Primer</i> to highlight modern styles of C++ programming. This edition gives center stage to using the standard library while deemphasizing techniques for low-level programming. We introduce the standard library much earlier in the text and have reformulated the examples to take advantage of library facilities. We have also streamlined and reordered the presentation of language topics.</p> <p>In addition to restructuring the text, we have incorporated several new elements to enhance the reader's understanding. Each chapter concludes with a Chapter Summary and glossary of Defined Terms, which recap the chapter's most important points. Readers should use these sections as a personal checklist: If you do not understand a term, restudy the corresponding part of the chapter. </p> <p>We've also incorporated a number of other learning aids in the body of the text:</p> <ul> <li>Important terms are indicated in <b>bold</b>; important terms that we assume are already familiar to the reader are indicated in <b> <i>bold italics.</i> </b> Each term appears in the chapter's Defined Terms section.</li> <li>Throughout the book, we highlight parts of the text to call attention to important aspects of the language, warn about common pitfalls, suggest good programming practices, and provide general usage tips. We hope that these notes will help readers more quickly digest important concepts and avoid common pitfalls. </li> <li>To make it easier to follow the relationships among features and concepts, we provide extensive forward and backward cross-references.</li> <li>We have provided sidebar discussions that focus on important concepts and supply additional explanations for topics that programmers new to C++ often find most difficult.</li> <li>Learning any programming language requires writing programs. To that end, the primer provides extensive examples throughout the text. Source code for the extended examples is available on the Web at the following URL: </li> </ul> http://www.awprofessional.com/cpp_primer <p>What hasn't changed from earlier versions is that the book remains a compre-hensive tutorial introduction to C++. Our intent is to provide a clear, complete and correct guide to the language. We teach the language by presenting a series of examples, which, in addition to explaining language features, show how to make the best use of C++. Although knowledge of C (the language on which C++ was originally based) is not assumed, we do assume the reader has programmed in a modern block-structured language.</p> <p><b>Structure of This Book</b></p> <p>C++ Primer provides an introduction to the International Standard on C++, covering both the language proper and the extensive library that is part of that standard. Much of the power of C++ comes from its support for programming with abstractions. Learning to program effectively in C++ requires more than learning new syntax and semantics. Our focus is on how to use the features of C++ to write programs that are safe, that can be built quickly, and yet offer performance comparable to the sorts of low-level programs often written in C.</p> <p>C++ is a large language and can be daunting to new users. Modern C++ can be thought of as comprising three parts: </p> <ul> <li>The low-level language, largely inherited from C</li> <li>More advanced language features that allow us to define our own data types and to organize large-scale programs and systems </li> <li>The standard library, which uses these advanced features to provide a set of useful data structures and algorithms </li> </ul> <p>Most texts present C++ in this same order: They start by covering the low-level details and then introduce the more advanced language features. They explain the standard library only after having covered the entire language. The result, all too often, is that readers get bogged down in issues of low-level programming or the complexities of writing type definitions and never really understand the power of programming in a more abstract way. Needless to say, readers also often do not learn enough to build their own abstractions.</p> <p>In this edition we take a completely different tack. We start by covering the basics of the language and the library together. Doing so allows you, the reader, to write significant programs. Only after a thorough grounding in using the library-- and writing the kinds of abstract programs that the library allows--do we move on to those features of C++ that will enable you to write your own abstractions.</p> <p>Parts I and II cover the basic language and library facilities. The focus of these parts is to learn how to write C++ programs and how to use the abstractions from the library. Most C++ programmers need to know essentially everything covered in this portion of the book.</p> <p>In addition to teaching the basics of C++, the material in Parts I and II serves another important purpose. The library facilities are themselves abstract data types written in C++. The library can be defined using the same class-construction features that are available to any C++ programmer. Our experience in teaching C++ is that by first using well-designed abstract types, readers find it easier to understand how to build their own types.</p> <p>Parts III through V focus on how we can write our own types. Part III introduces the heart of C++: its support for classes. The class mechanism provides the basis for writing our own abstractions. Classes are also the foundation for object-oriented and generic programming, which we cover in Part IV. The <i>Primer</i> concludes with Part V, which covers advanced features that are of most use in structuring large, complex systems.</p> <br> <br> 0201721481P01312005</p><h2>The Psychologist As Detective: An Introduction to Conducting Research in Psychology</h2><p>For undergraduate courses in Experimental Psychology, Research Methods, or Experimental Design. This text conveys the excitement of research methodology through a lively, conversational style. To make the study of the research process interactive and accessible, student-focused features and critical thinking activities are integrated throughout the text. Actual student research appears in each chapter to increase relevance and heighten student interest.</p><p>Preface Note to the Instructor <p> Margery Franklin (1990) quotes former Clark University professor and chair Heinz Werner's views on psychological research. Werner indicated: </p><p> I got rather apprehensive at finding that students were frequently<br> taught that there was only one acceptable way of conduct in the<br> laboratory&#x2014;there has to be an hypothesis set up, or a set of hypotheses,<br> and the main job of the experimenter is to prove or disprove the hypothesis.<br> What is missed here is the function of the scientist as a discoverer and<br>explorer of unknown lands ....Hypotheses...are essential elements of inquiry,<br> but they are so, not as rigid propositions but as flexible parts of the<br> process of searching; by the same token, conclusions drawn from the results<br> are as much an end as a beginning ....Now...academic psychologists<br> are beginning to see research not as a rigid exercise of rules of a game<br> but as a problem solving procedure, a probing into unknown lands with plans<br> which are not fixed but modifiable, with progress and retreat, with ranching<br> out into various directions or concentration on one.</p><p></p><p> Clearly Werner's views are as applicable in the 21st Century as they were during the heyday of behaviorism; they reflect perfectly the intent of this text. </p><p> From our vantage point, research in psychology is like a detective case; hence, the title we have chosen, The Psychologist as Detective. A problem presents itself, clues are discovered, bits of evidence that compete for our attention must be evaluated and accepted or discarded, and, finally, a report or summary of the case (research) is prepared for consideration by our peers. </p><p> When presented in this light, the research process in psychology will, we believe, be an interesting and stimulating endeavor for students. In short, our goal is to attract students to psychological research because of its inherent interest. </p><p> To accomplish this goal several pedagogical features have been employed in this text: </p><p> 1. To provide a sense of relevance and continuity, the theme of "psychologist as detective" runs throughout the text. </p><p> 2. Interactive Style of Writing. Based on the belief that the experimental psychology&#x2014;research methods text should be lively and engaging, we employ an interactive, conversational style of writing that we hope will help draw students into the material being presented. </p><p> 3. The Psychological Detective Feature. The questions or situations posed by these sections that appear throughout each chapter will encourage students to engage in critical thinking exercises. These sections also serve as excellent stimulants for productive class discussions. </p><p> 4. Marginal Definitions. Key definitions appear in the margin, close to the introduction of the term in the text. </p><p> 5. Review Summaries. To help students master smaller chunks of material, each chapter contains several review summaries. </p><p> 6. Study Breaks. Each Review Summary is followed by a Study Break that students can use to test their mastery of the material they have just completed. These study breaks should be especially helpful to your students when they prepare for quizzes and examinations. </p><p> We hope that these special features will provide your students with a positive experience as they learn the fundamentals of research methodology in psychology. Note to the Student </p><p> Welcome to the world of psychological research! Because the two of us have taught this course for over fifty years (combined!), we have seen the excitement that research can generate in student after student. As you will learn, conducting psychological research is very much like being a detective on a case. </p><p> Throughout this text we have tried to make it perfectly clear that research is something that you can (and should) become involved in. We hope you will enjoy reading about the student projects that we use as research examples throughout this text. Student research projects are making valuable contributions to our field. We hope to see your name among those making such contributions! </p><p> At this point we encourage you to stop immediately to review the list of pedagogical features highlighted in the "Note to the Instructor"...Did you humor us by actually looking at that list? If not, please do so now. To make full use of this text, you need to become actively involved; these pedagogical features will help you. Active involvement means that you need to stop to think about The Psychological Detective sections immediately when you encounter them, refer to figures and tables when directed to do so, and complete the Study Breaks when they appear. Becoming actively involved in this course helps the material come alive; your grade and your future involvement in psychology will thank you.

While I grew up thinking that both Judaism and Christianity were great traditions, I soon learned that not everyone in Tulsa, OK, agreed. As I encountered ignorance about and prejudice toward Jews, I wanted to know why and wanted to know more about what religion was all about. Eventually when I began my doctoral program at Harvard, I decided that I wanted to study the religious, historical, and political interplay between Jews, Christians, and Muslims. <br><br> <b>Why were you so interested in those three monotheistic religions? </b><br> My wife and I lived in Egypt (one block from the now famous Tahrir Square) when I was a young scholar, and I was directly involved in the Iranian hostage conflict during the Carter administration, as I describe in the book. Those life-changing experiences ignited my efforts to understand the dynamics of religion and politics in the contemporary Middle East. The combination of some 40 trips to the Middle East and my observations of developments in Israel and the emerging influence of conservative Christians in the U.S. highlighted the often convoluted, confusing, and lethal mixture of religion and politics. It&#x2019;s been made painfully clear that even small numbers of religious zealots or extremists claiming inspiration from their religion can wreak havoc on a regional or even global scale. In the second decade of the 21st century, the stakes are far too high for us to avoid or underestimate the volatile mix of religion and politics. <br><br> <b>What&#x2019;s the most important thing people need to know to better understand the often confusing and clearly explosive mix of religion and politics in the Middle East and U.S. today? </b><br> We get a lot of our information about the dizzying swirl of recent events from religious leaders, politicians, and pundits&#x2014;often packaged in superficial sound bites. For most Americans today, this has produced a kind of &#x201c;detailed ignorance&#x201d; of Islam, the Middle East and the interplay of religion and politics. We have a lot of details and images but no framework for understanding. It might take some effort to develop such a framework, but it&#x2019;s far less daunting than you might imagine. If we look at the scriptural bases for each tradition and their historical origins and relationships, we can see that there isn&#x2019;t actually a fixed template for how they operate and interact. But we can see clearly the dangerous and often deadly results of fundamentalists in all three religions, people who claim that they know precisely what God requires for them and everyone else. It&#x2019;s always a &#x201c;work in progress.&#x201d; <br><br> <b>Are the dramatic developments in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Yemen, and other predominantly Muslim countries in 2011 a source of hope or cause for alarm? </b><br> Although our &#x201c;detailed ignorance&#x201d; tends to make us lump all these countries together, they are all different and distinctive. Tunisia is not Jordan; Egypt is not Syria. At the same time, there are common themes that connect the turbulent upheavals. While there are no easy answers or simple solutions, the book identifies resources and opportunities for people of faith and goodwill to help fashion a more hopeful future. When Religion Becomes Lethal identifies what&#x2019;s wrong or dangerous in order to point out healthy alternatives. Many of the key issues surfacing today are discussed in the book&#x2014;from the major sources of anger and frustration in many predominantly Muslim countries and the ways the Israeli-Palestinian conflict exacerbates problems throughout the region to the constructive and misguided ways U.S. policies have shaped and will shape events. In addition, as we demystify catch phrases like the so-called &#x201c;clash of civilizations&#x201d; and clarify what actually constitutes &#x201c;shari&#x2019;ah law,&#x201d; we can identify more positive ways to embrace the challenges in the U.S. and in the Middle East that loom before us. <br></p><p>"Building on decades of experience witnessing and affecting change in the Middle East, Charles Kimball gives a rich examination of religious conflict from the vantage point of a peacemaker.

When Religion Becomes Lethal answers key questions and provides a reliable framework for understanding why religious belief&#x2014;especially in the Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam&#x2014;so often leads to violence and what constructive steps can be taken to chart a more hopeful future.</p> <p>Kimball, an expert on comparative religion, has a profound understanding of the often-troubled history between the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim descendents of Abraham. He examines a litany of compelling questions that challenge us today including: Why are the turbulent religious forces now seemingly more threatening than ever before? How representative are violent extremists operating in the name of Islam? What do the large majority of Muslims really want? Is or should America be a Christian nation? What is a Christian nation? Is peace between Israel, the Palestinians, and neighboring Arab and Muslim states really possible? These questions perplex many of us as daily headlines remind us all how even small numbers of religious zealots can wreak havoc on a massive scale.</p> <p><i>When Religion Becomes Lethal</i> offers a reliable, insightful, and useful way of thinking about and engaging the critical issues of religion and politics.</p></p><h2>Exploring the Humanities: Creativity and Culture in the West (Combined Edition)</h2><p><p><b> </b><i>Introduction to the Humanities,</i> <i>Combined Edition</i> provides a comprehensive, color and illustration-filled compilation of the history of civilization. <i>Volume One</i> encompasses the development of art, culture, society, architecture and religion beginning with prehistory and the ancient Near East and progressing through the Renaissance periods. <i>Volume Two</i> examines humanity and its components from the reformation and reform in sixteenth-century Europe through to present day society.

For this book will be a truthful one.<br><br>It must be known, then, that from the creation of Adam to the present day, no man, whether Pagan, or Saracen, or Christian, or other, of whatever progeny or generation he may have been, ever saw or inquired into so many and such great things as Marco Polo above mentioned. Who, wishing in his secret thoughts that the things he had seen and heard should be made public by the present work, for the benefit of those who could not see them with their own eyes, he himself being in the year of our Lord 1298 in prison at Genoa, caused the things which are contained in the present work to be written by master Rustigielo, a citizen of Pisa, who was with him in the same prison at Genoa;* and he divided it into three parts.<br><br>CHAPTER 1<br><br>How the Two Brothers Polo Set Forth from Constantinople to Traverse the World<br><br>It should be known to the reader that, at the time when Baldwin II. was emperor of Constantinople&#x2020; where a magistrate representing the doge of Venice then resided, and in the year of our Lord 1260, Nicolo Polo, the father of the said Marco, and Maffeo, the brother of Nicolo, respectable and well-informed men, embarked in a ship of their own, with a rich and varied cargo of merchandise, and reached Constantinople in safety. After mature deliberation on the subject of their proceedings, it was determined, as the measure most likely to improve their trading capital, that they should prosecute their voyage into the Euxine or Black Sea. With this view they made purchases of many fine and costly jewels, and taking their departure from Constantinople, navigated that sea to a port named Soldaia, from whence they travelled on horseback many days until they reached the court of a powerful chief of the Western Tartars, named Barka, who dwelt in the cities of Bolgara and Sarra, and had the reputation of being one of the most liberal and civilized princes hitherto known amongst the tribes of Tartary. He expressed much satisfaction at the arrival of these travellers, and received them with marks of distinction. In return for which courtesy, when they had laid before him the jewels they brought with them, and perceived that their beauty pleased him, they presented them for his acceptance. The liberality of this conduct on the part of the two brothers struck him with admiration; and being unwilling that they should surpass him in generosity, he not only directed double the value of<br><br>*A truce between Genoa and Venice, signed in July 1299, undoubtedly released both Marco Polo and his scribe Rustigielo. (See Sir Henry Yule&#x2019;s introduction to his great scholarly work Ser Marco Polo.) &#x2020; Baldwin II. reigned from 1237 to 1261.<br><br>the jewels to be paid to them, but made them in addition several rich presents.<br><br>The brothers having resided a year in the dominions of this prince, they became desirous of revisiting their native country, but were impeded by the sudden breaking out of a war between him and another chief, named Ala�, who ruled over the Eastern Tartars. In a fierce and very sanguinary battle that ensued between their respective armies, Ala� was victorious, in consequence of which, the roads being rendered unsafe for travellers, the brothers could not attempt to return by the way they came; and it was recommended to them, as the only practicable mode of reaching Constantinople, to proceed in an easterly direction, by an unfrequented route, so as to skirt the limits of Barka&#x2019;s territories. Accordingly they made their way to a town named Oukaka, situated on the confines of the kingdom of the Western Tartars. Leaving that place, and advancing still further, they crossed the Tigris [Volga], one of the four rivers of Paradise, and came to a desert, the extent of which was seventeen days&#x2019; journey, wherein they found neither town, castle, nor any substantial building, but only Tartars with their herds, dwelling in tents on the plain. Having passed this tract they arrived at length at a well-built city called Bokhara, in a province of that name, belonging to the dominions of Persia, and the noblest city of that kingdom, but governed by a prince whose name was Barak. Here, from inability to proceed further, they remained three years.<br><br>It happened while these brothers were in Bokhara, that a person of consequence and gifted with eminent talents made his appearance there. He was proceeding as ambassador from Ala� before mentioned, to the Great Khan,* supreme chief of all the Tartars, named Kublai, whose residence was at the extremity of the continent, in a direction between north-east and east. Not having ever before had an opportunity, although he wished it, of seeing any na- tives of Italy, he was gratified in a high degree at meeting and con-<br><br>* Khan 5 Lord. Kublai was also called the Great Kaan. Kaan 5 Supreme Sovereign (Lord of Lords). Polo always referred to Kublai in writing as the Great Khan and to lesser princes as Khan.<br><br>versing with these brothers, who had now become proficients in the Tartar language; and after associating with them for several days, and finding their manners agreeable to him, he proposed to them that they should accompany him to the presence of the Great Khan, who would be pleased by their appearance at his court, which had not hitherto been visited by any person from their country; adding assurances that they would be honourably received, and recompensed with many gifts. Convinced as they were that their endeavours to return homeward would expose them to the most imminent risks, they agreed to this proposal, and recommending themselves to the protection of the Almighty, they set out on their journey in the suite of the ambassador, attended by several Christian servants whom they had brought with them from Venice.<br><br>The course they took at first was between the north-east and north, and an entire year was consumed before they were enabled to reach the imperial residence, in consequence of the extraordinary delays occasioned by the snows and the swelling of the rivers, which obliged them to halt until the former had melted and the floods had subsided. Many things worthy of admiration were observed by them in the progress of their journey, but which are here omitted, as they will be described by Marco Polo, in the sequel of the book.<br><br>CHAPTER 2 How the Great Khan Sent the Two Brothers as His Envoys to the Pope<br><br>Being introduced to the presence of the Great Khan, Kublai, the travellers were received by him with the condescension and affability that belonged to his character, and as they were the first Latins who had made their appearance in that country, they were entertained with feasts and honoured with other marks of distinction. Entering graciously into conversation with them, he made earnest inquiries on the subject of the western parts of the world, of the Emperor of the Romans, and of other Christian kings and princes. He wished to be informed of their relative consequence, the extent of their possessions, the manner in which justice was administered in their several kingdoms and principalities, how they conducted themselves in warfare, and above all he questioned them particularly respecting the Pope, the affairs of the Church, and the religious worship and doctrine of the Christians. Being well instructed and discreet men, they gave appropriate answers upon all these points, and as they were perfectly acquainted with the Tartar language, they expressed themselves always in becoming terms; insomuch that the Great Khan, holding them in high estimation, frequently commanded their attendance.<br><br>When he had obtained all the information that the two brothers communicated with so much good sense, he expressed himself well satisfied, and having formed in his mind the design of employing them as his ambassadors to the Pope, after consulting with his ministers on the subject, he proposed to them, with many kind entreaties, that they should accompany one of his Barons, named Khogatal, on a mission to the See of Rome.<br><br>His object, he told them, was to make a request to his Holiness that he would send to him a hundred men of learning, thoroughly acquainted with the principles of the Christian religion, as well as with the seven arts,* and qualified to prove to the learned of his dominions by just and fair argument, that the faith professed by Christians is superior to, and founded upon more evident truth than, any other; that the gods of the Tartars and the idols worshipped in their houses were only evil spirits, and that they and the people of the East in general were under an error in reverenc- ing them as divinities.&#x2020; He, moreover, signified his pleasure that upon their return they should bring with them, from Jerusalem, some of the Holy Oil from the lamp which is kept burning over the Sepulchre of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom he professed to hold in veneration and to consider as the true God. Having heard these<br><br>* The seven arts of the time were: Rhetoric, Logic, Grammar, Arithmetic, Astronomy, Music, and Geometry. &#x2020; &#x201c;. . . and that if they would prove this, he and all under him would become Christians and the Church&#x2019;s liegemen&#x201d; (from Yule&#x2019;s translation).<br><br>commands addressed to them by the Great Khan they humbly prostrated themselves before him, declaring their willingness and instant readiness to perform, to the utmost of their ability, whatever might be the royal will. Upon which he caused letters, in the Tartarian language, to be written in his name to the Pope of Rome, and these he delivered into their hands.<br><br>He likewise gave orders that they should be furnished with a golden tablet displaying the imperial cipher, according to the usage established by his majesty; in virtue of which the person bearing it, together with his whole suite, are safely conveyed and escorted from station to station by the governors of all places within the imperial dominions, and are entitled, during the time of their residing in any city, castle, town, or village, to a supply of provisions and everything necessary for their accommodation.<br><br>Being thus honourably commissioned they took their leave of the Great Khan, and set out on their journey, but had not proceeded more than twenty days when the officer, named Khogatal, their companion, fell dangerously ill, and unable to proceed further, he halted at a certain city. In this dilemma it was determined, upon consulting all who were present, and with the approbation of the man himself, that they should leave him behind. In the prosecution of their journey they derived essential benefit from being provided with the royal tablet, which procured them attention in every place through which they passed. Their expenses were defrayed, and escorts were furnished. But notwithstanding these advantages, so great were the natural difficulties they had to encounter, from the extreme cold, the snow, the ice, and the flooding of the rivers, that their progress was unavoidably tedious, and three years elapsed before they were enabled to reach a sea-port town in the lesser Armenia, named Laiassus.</p><h2>The Word Book III: A Spelling Guide to Over 40,000 Words</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

In this book, Chris Bernhardt offers an introduction to quantum computing that is accessible to anyone who is comfortable with high school mathematics. He explains qubits, entanglement, quantum teleportation, quantum algorithms, and other quantum-related topics as clearly as possible for the general reader. Bernhardt, a mathematician himself, simplifies the mathematics as much as he can and provides elementary examples that illustrate both how the math works and what it means. </p><p>Bernhardt introduces the basic unit of quantum computing, the qubit, and explains how the qubit can be measured; discusses entanglement&#x2015;which, he says, is easier to describe mathematically than verbally&#x2015;and what it means when two qubits are entangled (citing Einstein's characterization of what happens when the measurement of one entangled qubit affects the second as &#x201c;spooky action at a distance&#x201d;); and introduces quantum cryptography. He recaps standard topics in classical computing&#x2015;bits, gates, and logic&#x2015;and describes Edward Fredkin's ingenious billiard ball computer. He defines quantum gates, considers the speed of quantum algorithms, and describes the building of quantum computers. By the end of the book, readers understand that quantum computing and classical computing are not two distinct disciplines, and that quantum computing is the fundamental form of computing.

Forty years later, E.B. White initiated a revision, and thus The Elements of Style became known as Strunk &amp; White. Following this same format, authors Charles Ellis and Burton Malkiel, two of the investment world's greatest thinkers, have combined their talents to produce The Elements of Investing&#x2014;a short, straight-talking book about investing and saving that will put you on a path towards a lifetime of financial success.</p> <p>The Elements of Investing lays to rest the popular shibboleths that undergird the hyperactive trading of the average investor. In it, Malkiel and Ellis skillfully focus their message to address the essentials and offer a set of simple, but powerful thoughts on how to avoid Mr. Market and his "loser's game," and instead enjoy the "winner's game" approach to investing.</p> <p>All the investment rules and principles you need to know are here&#x2014;with clear advice on how to follow them. In just two hours of reading time, you will learn all you need to know to be truly successful in investing. Divided into five essential elements of investing, this little book packs a big message that can help secure your financial future all the way through retirement. Topics touched upon include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Diversifying broadly over different types of securities with low-cost "total market" index funds and different asset types&#x2014;and why this is important</p> </li> <li> <p>Focusing on the long term instead of following market fluctuations that are likely to lead to costly investing mistakes</p> </li> <li> <p>Using employer-sponsored plans to supercharge your savings and minimize your taxes</p> </li> <li> <p>And much, much more</p> </li> </ul> <p>A disciplined approach to investing, complemented by understanding, is all you need to enjoy success. This practical guide explains what you really need to know and puts you on the right course for long-term success through all kinds of markets.</p><b>Praise for The Elements Of Investing</b> <p>"These noted authors have distilled all you need to know about investing into a very small package.

Board of Education</h2><p><p>"Don't talk to strangers" is the advice long given to children by parents of all classes and races. Today it has blossomed into a fundamental precept of civic education, reflecting interracial distrust, personal and political alienation, and a profound suspicion of others. In this powerful and eloquent essay, Danielle Allen, a 2002 MacArthur Fellow, takes this maxim back to Little Rock, rooting out the seeds of distrust to replace them with "a citizenship of political friendship."<br> <br> Returning to the landmark <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision of 1954 and to the famous photograph of Elizabeth Eckford, one of the Little Rock Nine, being cursed by fellow "citizen" Hazel Bryan, Allen argues that we have yet to complete the transition to political friendship that this moment offered. By combining brief readings of philosophers and political theorists with personal reflections on race politics in Chicago, Allen proposes strikingly practical techniques of citizenship. These tools of political friendship, Allen contends, can help us become more trustworthy to others and overcome the fossilized distrust among us.<br> <br> Sacrifice is the key concept that bridges citizenship and trust, according to Allen. She uncovers the ordinary, daily sacrifices citizens make to keep democracy working&#x2014;and offers methods for recognizing and reciprocating those sacrifices. Trenchant, incisive, and ultimately hopeful, <i>Talking to Strangers</i> is nothing less than a manifesto for a revitalized democratic citizenry.<br> </p></p><p><b>Danielle Allen </b>is the Director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics and James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University.&nbsp;The recipient of a MacArthur fellowship, she is the author or editor of many books.<p>&#x201c;Allen understands that democracy originates in the subjective dimension of everyday life, and she focuses on what she calls our &#x2018;habits of citizenship&#x2019;&#x2014;the ways we often unconsciously regard and interact with fellow citizens. If democracy resides in &#x2018;the very soul of subjectivity,&#x2019; then for Allen subjectivity itself cannot be understood apart from relationships. . . . Borrowing from Aristotle, the solution she proposes is friendship. &#x2018;Only the concept of friendship,&#x2019; Allen writes, &#x2018;captures the conjunction of faculties&#x2014;the orientation toward others, knowledge of the world, developed practices, and psychological effects&#x2014;that must be activated in democratic citizenship.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> (Nick Bromell <i>Boston Review</i>)<br><br>"The task of this book is to find ways for citizens to trust one another in these unsettled times. Doing so, Allen argues, requires developing habits of political friendship. The challenge of democratic politics, ironically, is to turn strangers into friends. . . . <i>Talking to Strangers</i> is engaging, well written, and tightly argued. Its interpretations of texts are excellent. . . . An important contribution to democratic theory." (Joel Olson <i>Perspectives on Politics</i>)<br><br>"It's an important book; best read and discussed with a friend. Don't miss this if you are concerned about the state of democracy, schooling, or our climate of civility."--Deborah Meier (Deborah Meier 2009-10-04)</p><h2>A Primer of Conservation Biology</h2><p><em>A Primer of Conservation Biology</em>, Fifth Edition, incorporates background, theory, and examples in a lively and readable text that will appeal to a wide audience and stimulate interest in conservation biology.

He attended the Jesuit College at Darjeeling and St. Edmund's School, Canterbury. His first literary work, <i>The Black Book</i>, appeared in Paris in 1938. His first collection of poems, <i>A Private Country</i>, was published in 1943, followed by the three Island books: <i>Prospero's Cell</i>; <i>Reflections on a Marine Venus</i>, about Rhodes; and <i>Bitter Lemons</i>, his account of life in Cyprus. Durrell's wartime sojourn in Egypt led to his masterpiece, <i>The Alexandria Quartet</i>, which he completed in southern France, where he settled permanently in 1957. Between the quartet and <i>The Avignon Quintet</i> he wrote the two-decker <i>Tunc </i>and <i>Nunquam</i>. His oeuvre includes plays, a book of criticism, translations, travel writing, and humorous stories about the diplomatic corps. <i>Caesar's Vast Ghost</i>, his reflections on the history and culture of Provence, including a late flowering of poems, was published a few days before his death in Sommi�res in 1990.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with JUSTINE, MOUNTOLIVE, and BALTHAZAR.]--The four linked novels that comprise English author Lawrence Durrell's masterpiece, THE ALEXANDRIA QUARTET, are set in Alexandria, Egypt, around the time of WWII. The four novels explore the city's polyglot society, full of intrigue, mystery, and sensuality, telling essentially the same story from different points of view. JUSTINE focuses on the beautiful Jewish wife of a wealthy Copt. Her story is told by Darley, her English lover. In BALTHAZAR, Darley reconsiders and retells the story he told in Justine, using information from a mysterious new character, Balthazar. In MOUNTOLIVE, as war begins to loom, British Ambassador David Mountolive enters the intrigues of the interwoven community of characters. In CLEA, Darley returns to a war-fevered Alexandria as the stories of the many characters move toward conclusion. Narrator Nigel Anthony provides a brilliant reading, keeping the variety of voices--English, French, Egyptian--distinct throughout. He offers a one-man play, conveying the passions, disappointments, and triumphs of the complex cast. The classical music interludes that delineate sections of this beautifully produced and packaged set help transport the listener to back- streets of Alexandria. R.E.K.

It is illustrated throughout by Sir John Tenniel, whose drawings for the books add so much to the enjoyment of them. Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Red Queen and the White Rabbit all make their appearances, and are now familiar figures in writing, conversation and idiom. So too, are Carroll&#39;s delightful verses such as The Walrus and the Carpenter and the inspired jargon of that masterly Wordsworthian parody, The Jabberwocky.</p><p>That Alice. When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here. "'What is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures?'" What indeed? (All ages)Founded in 1906 by J.M.

This long-awaited biographical memoir by one of Abbey's closest friends is a tribute to the gadfly anarchist who popularized environmental activism in his novel <i>The Monkey Wrench Gang</i> and articulated the spirit of the arid West in Desert Solitaire and scores of other essays and articles. In the course of a twenty-year friendship Ed Abbey and Jack Loeffler shared hundreds of campfires, hiked thousands of miles, and talked endlessly about the meaning of life. To read Loeffler's account of his best pal's life and work is to join in their friendship. <p>Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Abbey came west to attend the University of New Mexico on the G.I. Bill. His natural inclination toward anarchism led him to study philosophy, but after earning an M.A. he rejected academic life and worked off and on for years as a backcountry ranger and fire lookout around the Southwest. His 1956 novel <i>The Brave Cowboy</i> launched his literary career, and by the 1970s he was recognized as an important, uniquely American voice. Abbey used his talents to protest against the mining and development of the American West. By the time of his death he had become an idol to environmentalists, writers, and free spirits all over the West. </p><p>"Ed Abbey and Jack Loeffler were like Don Quijote and Sancho Panza. Loeffler delivers his friend, warts and all on a platter full of reverence and irreverence and carefully researched factual information, interspersed with hearty laughter and much serious consideration of all life's Great Questions. Jack's story elucidates and demythifies the Abbey legend, giving us powerful flesh and blood instead."--John Nichols</p></p><p>Now in paperback, this is a biographical memoir of Edward Abby, a free spirited author who, like no other before him, has truly influenced the American West. &#34;Jack&#39;s story elucidates and demythifies the Abbey legend, giving us powerful flesh and blood instead.&#34;--John NicholsJack Loeffler is a writer, ethnomusicologist, and radio producer in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p><h2>The Golden Pot and Other Tales: A New Translation by Ritchie Robertson (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Hoffmann, among the greatest and most popular of the German Romantics, is renowned for his humorous and sometimes horrifying tales of supernatural beings.

A rich and varied tale -- tender in its understanding of boyhood, crowded with the excitement of the backwoods hunt, with vivid descriptions of the primitive, beautiful hammock country, written with humor and earthy philosophy -- <i>The Yearling</i> is a novel for readers of all ages. Its glowing picture of a life refreshingly removed from modern patterns of living is universal in its revelation of simple courageous people and the beliefs they must live by. <br> This edition, complete with a new introduction by author Ivan Doig, will be cherished for years to come and will make a welcome addition to any booklover's shelf.</p><p>Fighting off a pack of starving wolves, wrestling alligators in the swamp, romping with bear cubs, drawing off the venom of a giant rattlesnake bite with the heart of a fresh-killed deer--it's all in a day's work for the Baxter family of the Florida scrublands. But young Jody Baxter is not content with these electrifying escapades, or even with the cozy comfort of home with Pa and Ma. He wants a pet, a friend with whom he can share his quiet cogitations and his corn pone. Jody gets his pet, a frisky fawn he calls Flag, but that's not all. With Flag comes a year of life lessons, frolicking times, and achingly hard decisions. This powerful book is as compelling now as when it was written over 60 years ago. Read simply as a naturalist study of the Florida interior, it fascinates and entices. Add the heart-stopping adventure and heart-wrenching human elements, and this is a classic well worth its Pulitzer Prize. Earthy dialect and homespun wisdom season the story, giving it a unique and unforgettable flavor, and N.C. Wyeth's warm, soft illustrations capture an era of rough subsistence and sweet survival.

Winner of Pulitzer Prize in 1938, <i>The Yearling</i> was made available the following year in a special edition illustrated by the distinguished American artist, N.C. Wyeth. The original paintings have been re-photographed and new plates made for this handsome volume.END</p><h2>Principles of Marketing (17th Ed)</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Winesburg, Ohio subtly portrays as well a young writer's coming of age, searching for love, yearning for a less stifling world.<br>Through the eyes of young George Willard, the inner lives of many of Winesburg's inhabitants open to us. Before George leaves the community, we have learned much about his mother Elizabeth, his friend Helen White, his teacher Kate Swift and other Winesburg residents &#x2014; the lonely, sensitive Dr. Reefy, the tormented Rev. Charles Hartman and the enigmatic Wing Biddlebaum among them.<br>Through Anderson's art, their stories are woven into a powerful portrayal of community life, and, ironically, of the isolation its close atmosphere can engender. A great success on its first publication in 1919, Winesburg, Ohio profoundly influenced a generation of fiction writers with its deeply moving poetic realism. It endures as a classic portrait of American life.</p><p><i>Library Journal</i> praised this edition of Sherwood Anderson's famed short stories as "the finest edition of this seminal work available." Reconstructed to be as close to the original text as possible, <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i> depicts the strange, secret lives of the inhabitants of a small town. In "Hands," Wing Biddlebaum tries to hide the tale of his banishment from a Pennsylvania town, a tale represented by his hands. In "Adventure," lonely Alice Hindman impulsively walks naked into the night rain. Threaded through the stories is the viewpoint of George Willard, the young newspaper reporter who, like his creator, stands witness to the dark and despairing dealings of a community of isolated people.In 1919 a middle-aged Chicago advertising writer from Ohio, a failure as a businessman, husband, and father, published a slim yellow book of short stories intended to &#34;reform&#34; American literature. Sherwood Anderson strove to portray the buried inner lives of &#34;pathetic grotesques&#34; - people wounded by life in body or spirit - and to tell their stories in short revelations rather than in sweeping novels. Against all expectations, Winesburg Ohio: A Group of Tales of Ohio Small Town Life accomplished what its author intended. Afterwards, American literature would be written and read differently. Writers of short fiction learned from Anderson to achieve both character-centered form and daring Modernist subject matter. Sherwood Anderson&#39;s Winesburg, Ohio, authorized by the Sherwood Anderson Literary Estate Trust, is an expert text, in that Ray Lewis White has consulted all Anderson manuscripts, typescripts, letters, diaries, and all editions of the book to present the masterpiece as it was intended. White&#39;s edition also is informed by his 35 years of experience in editing, studying, and appreciating Sherwood Anderson and his fiction. New to this edition of Winesburg, Ohio are historical and cultural annotations, documentation of changes of various editions, identification of the Ohio originals of Anderson&#39;s characters; and maps of the real town of Clyde, in North Central Ohio, which was the basis of Anderson&#39;s fictional account. Included as well are unique photographs of Anderson and Clyde that deepen knowledge and feeling for the author&#39;s time and his work.</p><h2>Academic Encounters Level 2 Student&#39;s Book Reading and Writing: American Studies</h2><p>The Academic Encounters Second edition series uses a sustained content approach to teach skills necessary for taking academic courses in English.

If you suffer from diabetes, hypertension, obesity, or any of a host of conditions that put you at risk for kidney disease, you owe it to yourself to read what is in this book. If you are among the 60,000 North Americans who go on dialysis each year, the information in this book could substantially improve your quality of life.<br> <br> In Coping with Kidney Disease, a leading expert tells you, in plain English, what you need to know to:<br> * Understand kidney failure<br> * Recognize early warning signs of kidney failure<br> * Get a proper diagnosis<br> * Talk with your doctors about it<br> * Confidently evaluate treatment options<br> * Take charge of your treatment<br> * Delay dialysis or even avoid the need for it altogether<br> The centerpiece of Coping with Kidney Disease is Dr. Walser's revolutionary 12-step program for avoiding dialysis. Based on treatments he has pioneered with his own patients at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the program calls for a supplemented low-protein diet supported by treatments to control blood pressure and correct high cholesterol. So effective has this breakthrough strategy proven to be that in many patients it actually worked to slow or arrest the progression of kidney failure to the end stage.<br> <br> Knowledge is power. Coping with Kidney Disease empowers you with what you need to take charge of kidney disease.</p><p>Mackenzie Walser, M.D., is Professor of Pharmacology and Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. <br> Betsy Thorpe is the coauthor of Carol Guber's Type 2 Diabetes Life Plan.Drawing on his work treating hundreds of adult kidney disease patients at his institution's Clinical Research Center, Walser (pharmacology &amp; medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine) aims to assist readers in understanding kidney failure, a condition that can be caused by diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Many of his points--e.g., how to recognize the early warning signs, get a correct diagnosis, and evaluate treatment options-are illustrated by the stories of real patients. Walser also presents a low protein diet as the center of his J 2-step treatment to help kidney disease patients avoid dialysis. Despite the use of patient stories and sample menus for the low protein diet, this book <i>will</i> not suit consumers owing to the prevalent medical jargon.

His new book is a historical, cultural, and linguistic survey of the Celtic peoples from prehistoric times to the modern era, presented in a series of 54 full-color maps with accompanying text and 160 illustrations. This approach is welcome, as recent historical atlases (e.g., Atlas of World History, Oxford Univ., 2001) have treated the Celts as peripheral to the classical civilizations and the evolution of the modern nation-states. The Times Atlas of European History (1994) provided some focus on the development of Ireland, Wales, and Scotland but is out of print. The atlas is divided into three parts: "The Continental Celts" (including the Urnfield, Hallstatt, and La T?ne cultures and the Gauls of Brittainy), "The Atlantic Celts" (covering the Britons and the evolution of Scotland, Ireland, and Wales), and "The Modern Celts" (covering the 18th to 20th centuries and the Celtic diaspora and revival). The maps range from a world view of the Celtic diaspora to Europe in general to European regions appropriate to the topic. An extensive chronology lists significant events in Celtic history from ca. 1200 B.C.E. to the 2001 opening of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Interestingly, although the chronology includes the only direct reference to the 1296-1328 Scottish Wars of Independence from England, there is no mention of William Wallace.

An iconoclastic send-up of the wine industry and a celebration of unsung grape varieties, the book features, among other things, Grahm's hilarious literary parodies--Joyce, Kafka, Pynchon, Salinger, and others--together with song lyrics, other snarky satires, poems, lectures, and more. Subtle undertones of gravitas with faint suggestions of earnestness lie beneath the humor, however, as Grahm passionately addresses the state of wine today: Where in wine does "greatness" truly repose? How might true originality in New World wines be found? Do New World winemakers have the integrity and courage to unreservedly embrace <i>terroir</i>? This trove includes a very personal take on Dante's <i>Inferno</i> (Grahm's own vision of Wine Hell) and a collection of tunes from the rock opera "Born to Rh�ne." Other pieces offer a fascinating glimpse into the history of the Rh�ne Ranger wine movement and of Bonny Doon itself, told through the story of its adventurous wine labels. <i>Been Doon So Long</i> is a highly entertaining journey to find the "truth of all things that may be found in the unlikely medium of a wineglass."</p><p>"Raise your glass to Randall Grahm. Long may he tickle our fancy."--Kermit Lynch, author of <i>Adventures on the Wine Route</i><br><br>"Long a fan of Bonny Doon, it cheered me to find Randall Grahm's writing just as irreverent and delicious as his approach to wine."--Kathleen Flinn, author of <i>The Sharper Your Knife, the Less You Cry</i><br><br>"Randall Grahm is the Willy Wonka of the wine world, and <i>Been Doon So Long</i> is intelligent, insightful, and mischievous.

He's a provocateur, a punster, a philosopher, and jester.

Now there&#x2019;s growing evidence that we influenced dogs&#x2019; evolution&#x2014;and they, in turn, changed ours. Even more than our closest relatives, the apes, dogs are the species with whom we communicate best.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining history, paleontology, biology, and cutting-edge medical science, Kay Frydenborg paints a picture of how two different species became deeply entwined&#x2014;and how we coevolved into the species we are today.</p><p><b>Kay Frydenborg</b> lives in Pennsylvania with her husband and two dogs.&nbsp;She's the author of numerous books for young readers including <i>Chocolate</i>,&nbsp;<i>A Dog in the Cave,&nbsp;Wild Horse Scientists, They Dreamed of Horses,</i> and <i>Animal Therapist</i>.<br><br> Website:&nbsp;kayfrydenborg.comGr 7 Up&#x2014;It may come as no surprise that our canine companions descended from wolves, but this title describes a coevolution and cooperation with humans that may have begun much earlier than scientists once estimated. The 1994 discovery and carbon dating of tracks of a wolflike dog and a boy in France's Chauvet Cave reveal that humans and dog companions walked together 26,000 years ago. This is an unfolding story, leading readers through the basics of evolutionary science and how findings lead to anthropological theories. The variations in breeds today are explained in terms of artificial vs. natural selection. American paleoanthropologist Pat Shipman suggests that wolves may have helped modern human ancestors survive the Paleolithic era, when Neanderthals could not, by teaching humans how to delegate pack responsibilities of protection, scouting, and babysitting. In turn, wolves learned to follow a human's gaze. The investigative puzzle emphasizes the importance of asking questions and collaborating with scientists from other fields to come up with answers. Color-blocked pages offer explanations of scientific processes, profile field-related tools, and relay asides about canine fanciers and 9/11 rescue dogs. The latter part of the book focuses on the intelligence, personality, and trainability of dogs and on current research on a shared community of disease-preventing microbes that shine a positive light on "sloppy dog kisses."

He characterizes it as an absolute inter-human relation beyond any form of structure.</p> <p><em>The Ritual Process</em> has acquired the status of a small classic since these lectures were first published in 1969. Turner demonstrates how the analysis of ritual behavior and symbolism may be used as a key to understanding social structure and processes. He extends Van Gennep's notion of the "liminal phase" of rites of passage to a more general level, and applies it to gain understanding of a wide range of social phenomena. Once thought to be the "vestigial" organs of social conservatism, rituals are now seen as arenas in which social change may emerge and be absorbed into social practice.</p> <p>As Roger Abrahams writes in his foreword to the revised edition: "Turner argued from specific field data. His special eloquence resided in his ability to lay open a sub-Saharan African system of belief and practice in terms that took the reader beyond the exotic features of the group among whom he carried out his fieldwork, translating his experience into the terms of contemporary Western perceptions. Reflecting Turner's range of intellectual interests, the book emerged as exceptional and eccentric in many ways: yet it achieved its place within the intellectual world because it so successfully synthesized continental theory with the practices of ethnographic reports."</p></p><p><p><em>Victor Turner</em> (1920-1983) was a research officer at the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute in Zambia, where he began what was to be a lifelong study of Ndembu village life, ritual, and symbolism. He taught at the University of Manchester from 1955 to 1963, when he moved to the United States. Turner served as professor of anthropology at Cornell University, 1964-1968. From 1968 to 1977, he was professor of anthropology and social thought at the University of Chicago, and then until the time of his death he was William R. Kenan Professor of Anthropology and Religion at the University of Virginia.</p><br><br><p> <i>Roger Abrahams</i> recently retired as director of the Center for Folklore and Ethnography at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><br><br><p><em>Alfred Harris</em>&nbsp;was a professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Rochester. He served as the chair of the anthropology from 1964-1971 and he was well known for being the editor of the Lewis Henry Morgan Lectures.</p><p> &#x201c;Turner&#x2019;s book is ingenious and erudite, rich in highly stimulating ideas beyond the ability of this review to exhibit...

The general theoretical stimulus of its second half will probably be its greatest attraction. Certainly here is a significant contribution not merely to the &#x2018;ritual process&#x2019; in the narrower sense, but to the understanding of a great deal of the total social process of interaction and interdependence.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;P. H. Gulliver, <em>Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London</em></p> <p> &#x201c;This genial elaboration of his Henry Morgan Lectures delivered at Rochester University in 1966 suggests that Victor Turner is as much at home in the richly symbolic world of the contemporary American scene as he is in that of the Ndembu on which he has written so extensively.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;I.

Considering Turner&#x2019;s convincing analysis of the source of religious rites in universal human circumstance, the wonder is not that people continue to create symbolic ritual systems, but that these systems go stale or become perverted, and that people lose belief, often with anxiety, but also with a sense of liberation.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Charles Leslie, <em>Science</em></p> <p> &#x201c;<em>The Ritual Process</em> begins with an examination of women&#x2019;s rituals among the Ndembu...&nbsp; [Turner&#x2019;s] theories are enlivened.&#x201d;</p> <p> &#x2014;Anthony Graham-White, <em>Educational Theatre Journal</em></p> <p> &#x201c;These two books of essays by one of the leading students of ritual and symbolism have both a personal and a general interest.

In seeking the answer, Merlin Donald traces the evolution of human culture and cognition from primitive apes to artificial intelligence, presenting an enterprising and original theory of how the human mind evolved from its presymbolic form.</p><p>Merlin Donald is Emeritus Professor in the Department of Psychology at Queen&#x2019;s University, Kingston, Ontario.``The modern era, if it can be reduced to any single dimension, is especially characterized by its obsession with symbols and their management.'' So says Donald (Psychology/Queen's Univ., Kingston, Ontario), echoing the philosopher Ernst Cassirer a generation ago--with a difference. Whereas countless philosophers since Aristotle have attempted to define what is quintessentially human, Donald brings new knowledge of neuropsychology, ethology, and archaeology to propose a tripartite theory of the transition from ape to man. Using the fossil evidence of braincase size and tool-kit remains, Donald concludes that the australopithecines were limited to concrete/episodic minds: bipedal creatures able to benefit from pair-bonding, cooperative hunting, etc., but essentially of a seize-the-moment mentality. The first transition was to a ``mimetic'' culture: the era of Homo erectus in which mankind absorbed and refashioned events to create rituals, crafts, rhythms, dance, and other prelinguistic traditions. This was followed by the evolution to mythic cultures: the result of the acquisition of speech and the invention of symbols. The third transition carried oral speech to reading, writing, and an extended external memory- store seen today in computer technology. This summary, however, does not do justice to Donald's careful analysis of rival theories as well as his mining of the neuroanatomical and neurological literature, presenting, for example, evidence of the distribution of language skills across both hemispheres. He gets high marks, too, for pointing out how often cognitive theories become caught up in the trap of the homunculus--the little man in the brain who presides over all our conscious activities. Needless to say, his theory is open to challenge as well (the relation of mimesis to language; the constant reliance on computer metaphors; and, ultimately, the use of Western tradition as the paradigm of human evolution). Withal, a fine, provocative and absorbing account of what makes humans human. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Pesticide drift accidents have terrified and sickened many living in the country's most marginalized and vulnerable communities. In this book, Jill Lindsey Harrison considers political conflicts over pesticide drift in California, using them to illuminate the broader problem and its potential solutions. </p><p>The fact that pesticide pollution and illnesses associated with it disproportionately affect the poor and the powerless raises questions of environmental justice (and political injustice). Despite California's impressive record of environmental protection, massive pesticide regulatory apparatus, and booming organic farming industry, pesticide-related accidents and illnesses continue unabated. To unpack this conundrum, Harrison examines the conceptions of justice that increasingly shape environmental politics and finds that California's agricultural industry, regulators, and pesticide drift activists hold different, and conflicting, notions of what justice looks like. </p><p>Drawing on her own extensive ethnographic research as well as in-depth interviews with regulators, activists, scientists, and public health practitioners, Harrison examines the ways industry, regulatory agencies, and different kinds of activists address pesticide drift, connecting their efforts to communitarian and libertarian conceptions of justice. The approach taken by pesticide drift activists, she finds, not only critiques theories of justice undergirding mainstream sustainable-agriculture activism, but also offers an entirely new notion of what justice means. To solve seemingly intractable environmental problems such as pesticide drift, Harrison argues, we need a different kind of environmental justice. She proposes the precautionary principle as a framework for effectively and justly addressing environmental inequities in the everyday work of environmental regulatory institutions.</p></p><p>Jill Lindsey Harrison is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder.<p>Jill Harrison explores extensive pesticide health hazards and flawed regulation in one of the nation's biggest industries, where hard-working farm laborers suffer on a daily basis. This is a great contribution to scholarship on environmental justice, environmental health, and social movements.

While some have been coolly distant, even adversarial, others have found their intelligence agencies to be among the most valuable instruments of policy and power.<br><br>Since John F. Kennedy's presidency, this relationship has been distilled into a personalized daily report: a short summary of what the intelligence apparatus considers the most crucial information for the president to know that day about global threats and opportunities. This top secret document is known as the President's Daily Brief, or, within national security circles, simply the Book.&#x201d; Presidents have spent anywhere from a few moments (Richard Nixon) to a healthy part of their day (George W. Bush) consumed by its contents; some (Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush) consider it far and away the most important document they saw on a regular basis while commander in chief.<br><br>The details of most PDBs are highly classified, and will remain so for many years. But the process by which the intelligence community develops and presents the Book is a fascinating look into the operation of power at the highest levels. David Priess, a former intelligence officer and daily briefer, has interviewed every living president and vice president as well as more than one hundred others intimately involved with the production and delivery of the president's book of secrets. He offers an unprecedented window into the decision making of every president from Kennedy to Obama, with many character rich stories revealed here for the first time.</p><p><b>Dr. David Priess</b> served during the Bill Clinton and George W.

Lange&#x2019;s images of squatter camps, benighted farmers, and stark landscapes are stunning, and her captions&#x2014;which range from simple explanations of settings to historical notes and biographical sketches&#x2014;add unexpected depth, bringing her subjects and their struggles unforgettably to life, often in their own words.</p><p>When Lange was dismissed from the Farm Security Administration at the end of 1939, these photos and field notes were consigned to archives, where they languished, rarely seen.

Spirn, a photographer herself, traces Lange's path, visiting her locations and subjects in a fascinating series of 'then and now' shots, an homage to Lange, who Spirn compellingly argues deserves to take her place as 'one of the most important American artists of the Twentieth Century.'"

Whether you are a president or a terrorist, if you don't understand how to deploy the power of social media effectively you may win the odd battle but you will lose a twenty-first century war. Here, journalist David Patrikarakos draws on unprecedented access to key players to provide a new narrative for modern warfare. He travels thousands of miles across continents to meet a de-radicalized female member of ISIS recruited via Skype, a liberal Russian in Siberia who takes a job manufacturing "Ukrainian" news, and many others to explore the way social media has transformed the way we fight, win, and consume wars-and what this means for the world going forward.</p><p><b>David Patrikarakos</b> is the author of <i>Nuclear Iran: the Birth of an Atomic State</i>, a contributing editor at the <i>Daily Beast</i>, and a contributing writer at <i>Politico</i>.

Corning's innovations made possible such essential items as light bulbs, television, Pyrex, catalytic converters for cars, and high-speed telecommunications through fiber optics. Most impressive is Corning's evolution into a highly innovative producer of specialty materials. In its early days, Corning developed specialty glass for use in railroad signal lenses that had to withstand the rigors of high and low temperatures; and developed its high speed Ribbon Machine--still used today--to produce glass envelopes for light bulbs more quickly and efficiently than anyone else. Today Corning leads the world in fiber optics and is a premier provider of cable and photonic products. In 1999 <em>Wired</em> magazine nominated Corning for its coveted Wired Index, confirming Corning's astonishing staying power as a leading-edge company.<br> <em>Corning and the Craft of Innovation</em> examines how Corning fostered a culture of innovation while showing extraordinary patience in backing long-term projects. The book illustrates how a pattern of deliberate, regular, and profitable innovation begun 150 years ago, has put Corning at the vanguard of leading-edge technologies for the fastest-growing markets of the global marketplace. It will be essential reading for anyone interested in strategic management, innovation, science and technology or knowledge management.<br></p><p><br><strong>Margaret B.W.

Currently, she is a visiting professor of management at McGill University in Quebec. <strong>Alec Shuldiner</strong> is a member of The Winthrop Group.<br>These two books, along with a third volume (the forthcoming Corning Through the Ages), were commissioned by Corning to mark 150 years in business. While such an endeavor is inevitably self-serving, the authors have been allowed to present both the accomplishments (and they are numerous) and the sticking points and warts. In The Generations of Corning, Dyer and Gross detail the history of the organization from its inception to the current day. From a business perspective, it is intriguing to learn how a company was able to take a fundamental material glass and both develop its particular formulation and engineer the industrial process to expedite manufacturing. This was true for the electric light bulb, fiber optics, and a host of other industrial and consumer products. The history also shows how Corning leveraged its competencies through large-scale partnerships. In Corning and the Craft of Innovation, history is subjugated to more specific topics. Hence, Gross and Shuldiner deal with glassmaking as both an art and a science, the realm of processes, and military applications. Perhaps the greatest value of the book is in showing how Corning came to embody what in today's jargon is a "learning organization." As a result, an organization that made its living off the mundane (e.g., the light bulb) was able to create the spectacular (e.g., the 200" telescope mirror). While each work covers much the same material, the scientist may prefer Craft and the social economist, Generations; both books are recommended.

Very Good conditions.

Jane Addams&#x2019;s original text has been reduced by about 35 percent, making it more accessible to undergraduates while maintaining the integrity of the original work. Her narrative of life in an immigrant urban neighborhood provides students with an entry into the ideology of the Progressive era and the tenets of social activism. The introduction provides a brief biographical sketch of Addams, outlines the decisions and conviction that led her to found Hull-House, and includes a vivid description of turn-of-the-century Chicago. Related documents include a description of life at Hull-House from the perspective of an immigrant who frequented it, an early review of Addams&#x2019;s tale, and perspectives from other reformers. Useful apparatus includes photographs, a chronology, a bibliography, and an index.</p><p>While on a trip to East London in 1883, Jane Addams witnessed a distressing scene late one night: masses of poor people were bidding on rotten vegetables that were unsalable anywhere else.<p> </p><blockquote> Their pale faces were dominated by that most unlovely of human expressions, the cunning and shrewdness of the bargain-hunter who starves if he cannot make a successful trade, and yet the final impression was not of ragged, tawdry clothing nor of pinched and sallow faces, but of myriads of hands, empty, pathetic, nerveless, and workworn, showing white in the uncertain light of the street, and clutching forward for food which was already unfit to eat. </blockquote><p> This scene haunted Addams for the next two years as she traveled through Europe, and she hoped to find a way to ease such suffering. Five years later, she visited Toynbee Hall, a London settlement house, and resolved to replicate the experiment in the U.S. On September 18, 1889, Jane Addams and her friend Ellen Starr moved into the second floor of a rundown mansion in Chicago's West Side. From the outset, they imagined Hull-House as a "center for a higher civic and social life" in the industrial districts of the city. Addams, Starr, and several like-minded individuals lived and worked among the poor, establishing (among other things) art classes, discussion groups, cooperatives, a kindergarten, a coffee house, a lending library, and a gymnasium. In a time when many well-to-do Americans were beginning to feel threatened by immigrants, Hull-House embraced them, showed them the true meaning of democracy, and served as a center for philanthropic efforts throughout Chicago.</p><p> Hull-House also provided an outlet for the energies of the first generation of female college graduates, who were educated for work yet prevented from doing it. In some respects, however, Addams's impressive work, often hailed by historians as "revolutionary," was nothing of the sort. She embraced the sexual stereotypes of her day, and, though she was clearly an independent woman, soothed public fears by acting primarily in the traditional roles of nurturer and caregiver. Hull-House was a rousing success, and it inspired others to follow in Addams's footsteps.</p><p> Though <i>Twenty Years at Hull-House</i> is meant to be an autobiography, it is Hull-House itself that stands in the spotlight. Addams devotes the first third of the book to her upbringing and influences, but the remainder focuses on the organization she built--and the benefits accruing to those who work with the poor as well as to the poor themselves. At times Addams's prose is difficult to follow, but her ideals and her actions are truly inspiring. A classic work of history--and a model for today's would-be philanthropists. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>One of the most important books ever written in the Unites States, Twenty Years at Hull-House remains a classic because it addresses large questions of human destiny and social justice in terms that are as relevant today as they were one hundred years ago.&#39;Kathryn Kish Sklar, author of Catherine Beecher: A Study in American Domesticity</p><h2>Discovering Our Past: A History of the World, Teacher Edition (MS WORLD HISTORY)</h2><p>Maximize learning and minimize preparation time with lesson plans, activities, and assessment support based on the research of Jay McTighe, co-author of Understanding by Design</p><p></p><h2>Personal Finance: Turning Money Into Wealth (The Prentice Hall Series in Finance)</h2><p>Through the presentation of the Ten Fundamental Principles of Personal Finance, this text empowers students with the knowledge they need to successfully make and carry out a plan for their own financial future.</p><p>Keown of Virginia Polytechnic Institute</p><h2>Pro Git (Expert&#39;s Voice in Software Development)</h2><p><p>Git is the version control system developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development.

Give me choices.&#x201d;<br><br>For revenge, the belief is &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t belong, and that hurts, so I&#x2019;ll get even by hurting others.&#x201d; The coded message that provides clues for encouragement is &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hurting. Validate my feelings.&#x201d;<br><br>For assumed inadequacy, the belief is &#x201c;I give up. Leave me alone.&#x201d; The coded message that provides clues for encouragement is &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give up on me. Show me a small step.&#x201d;<br><br>Often Dreikurs was asked why he kept putting children in these boxes. He said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t keep putting them there; I keep finding them there.&#x201d;<br><br>It is understandable that parents often react to misbehavior. How you feel in reaction to your child&#x2019;s behavior is your first clue in breaking the code to your child&#x2019;s behavior.<br><br>When a child&#x2019;s goal is misguided power, some parents may say they feel helpless to &#x201c;make&#x201d; the child do what he or she is supposed to do. At a deeper level, these parents may be feeling challenged or defeated because they �aren&#x2019;t winning the power struggle. Many parents today still struggle with shifting from autocratic rule (&#x201c;because I said so&#x201d; parenting) to democratic (authoritative) leadership (&#x201c;let&#x2019;s solve this together&#x201d;). Positive Discipline tools are designed to help parents across cultures shift away from inferior/superior relationships and �toward a model that teaches respect and dignity for each individual while focusing on teaching important life skills for finding solutions to �life&#x2019;s problems.<br><br>Check out the Mistaken Goal Detective Clue Form below to help you navigate the Mistaken Goal Chart on page 28&#x2013;31. It will help you &#x201c;break the code&#x201d; to your child&#x2019;s behavior, along with offering you clues for �encouragement&#x2014;�ways to inspire your child to choose more empowering beliefs and behaviors.<br><br>Mistaken Goal Detective Clue Form<br><br>1. Think of a recent challenge you had with your child. Write it down. Describe what occurred as though you are writing a script: what did your child do, how did you react, and then what �happened?<br><br>2. What were you feeling when you were in the middle of this �challenge? (Choose a feeling from Column 2 of the Mistaken Goal Chart.) Write it down.<br><br>3. Now move your finger to the right across the row over to Column 3 of the Mistaken Goal Chart to see if the action you took in response to that feeling comes close to one of these typical responses. If your action is described in a different row instead, �double-�check to see if there is a feeling in another row in Column 2 that better represents how you were feeling at a deeper level. (We often say we are feeling &#x201c;annoyed&#x201d; when, at a deeper level, we are feeling challenged or hurt; we often say we feel &#x201c;�hopeless&#x201d; or &#x201c;helpless&#x201d; when we �really feel challenged or defeated in a power struggle.) How you react is a clue to your deeper feelings.<br><br>4. Now move your finger to the right across the row to Column 4. Do any of these descriptions come close to what the child did in response to your reaction?<br><br>5. Once you&#x2019;ve identified what the child did in response to your reaction, move your finger left across the row to Column 1. It is likely that this is your child&#x2019;s mistaken goal. Write it down.<br><br>6. Now move your finger to the right across the row to Column 5. You have just discovered what your child&#x2019;s discouraging belief may be. Write it down.<br><br>7. Move your finger over to Column 6. Does this come close to a belief you have that may contribute to your child&#x2019;s behavior? (Remember, this is not about �blame&#x2014;�only awareness.) While you are learning skills to encourage your child, you will also change your belief. Try it now. Write down a belief that would be more encouraging to your child. You&#x2019;ll find clues in the last two �columns.<br><br>8. Move your finger to the right, over to Column 7, where you will find the coded message about what your child needs in order to feel encouraged.<br><br>9. Move once more to the right, to the last column, to find some ideas you could try the next time you encounter this challenging behavior. (You can also use the Positive Discipline Tool Cards and/or your own wisdom to think of something you could do or say that would speak to the coded message in Column 7.) Write down your plan.<br><br>10. How did it go? Record in your journal exactly what happened. You want to revisit your success stories for future encouragement. If your plan �wasn&#x2019;t successful, try another tool. (See &#x201c;Connection Before Correction,&#x201d; later in this chapter, and make sure you first make a connection before making a correction.)<br><br>You will notice that the Mistaken Goal Chart includes a column called &#x201c;How adults may contribute to the problem.&#x201d; Helping parents become aware of how they contribute to misbehavior can be very touchy. For this reason, we will say over and over that it is not about blame or shame, but awareness.<br><br>Identifying the belief behind the behavior and the mistaken goal is not always easy, because children may use the same behaviors to achieve any of the four mistaken goals. For example, children may refuse to do their homework in order to gain attention (&#x201c;Look at me, look at me&#x201d;), to show power (&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t make me&#x201d;), to seek revenge (&#x201c;It hurts that my grades are more important to you than I am, so I will hurt you back&#x201d;), or to express their sense of inadequacy (&#x201c;I �really can&#x2019;t&#x201d;). Parents have different feelings in each case. Effective intervention and encouragement will be different for each goal, so it is important that you use your reaction feeling as a clue to understand your child&#x2019;s goal.<br><br>Note that we talk about &#x201c;encouragement.&#x201d; It does not matter whether the child&#x2019;s beliefs are based on facts or on her perception of the situation. Behavior is based on what children believe is true, not what is true. Behavior changes when parents understand the belief and use encouragement (Positive Discipline tools) to help children find constructive ways to find belonging and significance.<br><br>Success Story from Korea<br><br>I have a �7-�year-�old girl and an �11-�year-�old boy. My daughter always wants to stay with me. Whenever I helped my son with his homework, she would stand in front of the door and ask me to come out and help her. Since I already spend so much time with her, I �couldn&#x2019;t understand why and used to scold her for her demanding so much attention.<br><br>I was feeling irritated, and worried about her constant whining.<br><br>I told her, &#x201c;I need to help your brother solve difficult problems, so don&#x2019;t stand in front of the door. Go to your room and play with your toys.&#x201d; She would go to her room for a little while, but later she would resume the same behavior, calling me again for any of several reasons: &#x201c;Read me a book,&#x201d; &#x201c;Play a game with me,&#x201d; &#x201c;Stay with me till I fall asleep.&#x201d;<br><br>When I studied the Mistaken Goal Chart, I could see that her mistaken goal was undue attention. Her belief was &#x201c;I feel significant only when I&#x2019;m being noticed or getting special service.&#x201d; Her coded message was &#x201c;Notice me. Involve me usefully.&#x201d;<br><br>I decided to redirect my daughter when she tried to gain my attention. The next time she called me when I was working with my son, I said with kindness and firmness, &#x201c;I love you and will spend time with you later.&#x201d;<br><br>She seemed satisfied and stayed in her room, drawing. Later I asked her what she wanted to do with me. She wanted to play the piano, so we played together. After that, the number of times she called me while I was working with her brother decreased.<br><br>&#x2014;�Seonghwan Kim, Certified Positive Discipline Educator<br><br>Success Story from Prince George, British Columbia, Canada<br><br>My child kept taking ingredients off the counter while I was preparing dinner. I had just learned about the Mistaken Goal Chart. I felt irritated, so I realized his mistaken goal was undue attention.<br><br>Before learning about the mistaken goals, I would keep reminding him that dinner would be ready soon and that he should wait to eat. He seemed to think it was funny and would take more food when I told him to wait.<br><br>It seemed true that his belief could be &#x201c;I belong only when you pay attention to me&#x201d; and that his annoying behavior was intended to gain my attention.<br><br>I decided to try something related to the coded message &#x201c;Notice me. Involve me usefully.&#x201d; I cleared a space on the counter, prepared a bowl with some carrots in it, and asked him if he would like to sit with me while I prepared dinner.

Don&#x2019;t expect children to know what to do without �step-�by-�step training. For example, their standards of cleanliness differ wildly from yours, so you can&#x2019;t simply tell your child to clean his room and expect him to clean it to your satisfaction.<br><br>1. Explain the task in a kind way as you perform it, while your child watches.<br><br>2. Do the task together.<br><br>3. Have your child do it by herself while you supervise.<br><br>4. When she feels ready, let her perform the task on her own.<br><br>Jane<br><br>Parents often don&#x2019;t take time for training because life is hectic or because they don&#x2019;t fully understand how important it is for children to contribute and how essential it is that they learn the skills that will allow them to contribute. Too many parents think children should be allowed to be children and that they can learn skills later. They do not realize that children develop beliefs about their capabilities during early childhood.<br><br>The following question from Tamee on the Positive Discipline Social Network (used by permission) provides an excellent opportunity for me to explain how to take time for training.<br><br>This morning my �5-�year-�old put a bunch of dirty dishes from the sink into the dishwasher. It made me happy to see her doing this. Afterward I told her that was very helpful.<br><br>Then she said, &#x201c;Since I did that for you, would you bring all my breakfast things to the table?&#x201d;<br><br>I �didn&#x2019;t �really think that was a good idea, since it would make doing dishes seem like something to do to get something in return. I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m willing to bring the gallon of milk out and pour it. You can do the rest.&#x201d;<br><br>She started crying, saying it �wasn&#x2019;t fair that I �didn&#x2019;t do half of her breakfast things. It became a fit and she said, &#x201c;Fine! I&#x2019;ll just do it all myself!&#x201d; which led to her feeling sorry for herself, having to pour the big heavy gallon all by herself and blaming me for it. Help!<br><br>I asked Tamee if her daughter was used to getting rewards from someone else. Tamee shared that her �ex-�husband and �ex-�mother-�in-�law used rewards all the time. It �wasn&#x2019;t a difficult guess to make, because her daughter&#x2019;s behavior was typical of the �long-�term results of rewards.<br><br>My suggestion for Tamee was to let her daughter have her feelings without trying to rescue her or talk her out of them, and then later take time for training by brainstorming together to create a list of things they could do for other people without expecting anything in return. This is a good example of seeing challenges as opportunities for teaching skills.<br><br>You can make time for training fun by turning it into a game. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s find at least one thing to do for each other every day as a surprise, and see how long it takes the other person to find out what it was.&#x201d; This could be expanded at dinnertime discussions by sharing, &#x201c;What did you do for someone else today without expecting anything back?&#x201d;<br><br>We need to take time for training in many areas, such as manners and problem solving, instead of expecting children to learn from our lectures. Children may resist the training you provide in your home (it is part of their individuation �process&#x2014;�always testing how to use their power in a safe place), but your friends and neighbors will notice and tell you what a great kid you have. Get over your shock and keep taking time for training, even when it seems like it isn&#x2019;t working.</p><h2>Cowboys &amp; Images: The Watercolors of William Matthews</h2><p>In the venerable tradition of Frederic Remington and N.C.

The reader is guided through the process of ''getting'' this new vision, and then through the specifics of applying it via&nbsp;Carpenter's&nbsp;"system improvement" methodology.&nbsp;<br><br>For start-ups or&nbsp;multinationals, the methodology is simple, believable, and mechanical; not mystical or theoretical.&nbsp;Carpenter developed the "systems mindset" protocol in the business he purchased in 1984 and still owns today. With that company, he moved from an 80-100 hour workweek to a 2 hour workweek, while multiplying his income dozens of times over. He is CEO of an international business consulting firm,&nbsp;and&nbsp;several other&nbsp;spin-off&nbsp;businesses, as well as an international non-profit,&nbsp;all of which are&nbsp;operated in the same systems mindset&nbsp;fashion. With a diverse background in engineering, construction and business management, publishing, telecommunications and journalism, he calls his approach a "workingman's philosophy." See workthesystem.com.<br><br><i>Work the System: The Simple Mechanics of Making More and Working Less</i> will show the&nbsp;business&nbsp;owner how to achieve a positive macro result by looking at business and work on a micro level; by analyzing and refining&nbsp;the separate&nbsp;internal sub-systems, the systems that, added together, comprise the whole primary system business entity. Readers will learn how to "tweak" this "system of systems" in order to maximize profits, create client loyalty, and develop autonomous employees. <br><br>The strategies help&nbsp;business owners to quickly and dramatically improve performance as well as&nbsp;decrease the stress of being overtaxed and disorganized, ultimately resulting in a substantially shorter work week and a much-improved bottom line. See testimonials of readers at workthesystem.com/testimonials.<br> In an unusual publishing arrangement,&nbsp;<i>Carpenter gives away his unabridged book in both PDF and audible formats via his website workthesystem.com.</i> This adversely affects Amazon, NY Times, etc. book sales ratings but meets his objective of wide distribution. The book is also available in hard copy in multiple languages including Chinese, Russian, and Japanese.</p><p>Work the System's&nbsp; main thrust goes beyond providing new information, although it does that. The root purpose of Work the System is to guide you to a new way of perceiving your life so you can gain better command of it and therefore be better able to get what you want. <br><br>There will be a mechanical adjustment in the way you see your world, and when this profound shift occurs, systems Methodology will make irrefutable sense, and your work and life will never be the same. I like to call this mini-awakening getting it, and I describe what it is and how to achieve it in Part One.<br><br>The Nutshell Premise? Your life is a collection of individual systems.<br><br>To whom is this book intended? It's for anyone who runs a business, from the founder of a brand new mom-and-pop start-up to the seasoned CEO of a multinational. At either extreme and in-between, the tenets apply uniformly because life's fundamental mechanics work the same, all the time, everywhere. This is about acquiring a better view of reality's universal simple mechanics; to viewing the machinations of your world with more precision.After a fifteen-year nightmare operating hisown stagnant business, Sam Carpenter developeda down-to-earth methodology thatknocked his routine eighty-hour workweekdown to just two hours--while multiplyinghis income twenty-fold.In Work the System, Carpenter reveals aprofound insight and the exact uncomplicated,mechanical steps he took to turn hisbusiness and life around without turning itupside down. Once you &#34;get&#34; this new vision,success and serenity will come quickly. Youwill learn to:* Make a simple perception adjustmentthat will change your life forever.* See your world as a logical collection oflinear systems that you can control.* Manage the systems that produceresults in your business and your life.* Stop fire-killing. Become a fi re-controlspecialist!* Maximize profit, create client loyalty,and develop enthusiastic employeeswho respect you.* Identify insidious &#34;errors of omission.&#34;* Maximize your biological and mechanical&#34;prime time&#34; so that you are workingat optimum efficiency.* Design the life you want--and then, inthe real world, quickly create it!You can keep doing what you have always done,and continue getting mediocre, unsatisfactoryresults.

The current century&#x2019;s catalogue of continuing violence against African Americans telegraphs that the structural inequality Lawrence documents is not confined to the past and that the &#x201c;whole of America&#x201d; has yet to absorb the lessons he aimed to teach. (Anne Monahan <i>CAA Reviews</i>) <br> <br>Thus, for many readers, the most powerful pages will inevitably be the 60 panels themselves, the deceptively childlike distillation of history and of the hopes and dreams propelling the movement that produced him. This family of images are together again as Lawrence wished them to be, as enduring now as the day he set them on gesso. (Isabel Wilkerson <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) <br> <br>Two impressions stand out. One is the terrifying obstinacy of racial injustice on the eve of the Second World War. The other is the moral grit that was needed to overcome it. In context, "Migration" appears as a hinge of the national consciousness: inward to the untold history of African-Americans and outward to the enlightenment of the wide world. It would not have worked were it not superb art, but it is. Melding modernist form and topical content, the series is both decorative and illustrative, and equally efficient in those fundamental, often opposed functions of painting. (Peter Schjeldahl <i>The New Yorker</i>) <br> <br>Lawrence used a deceptively simple structure &#x2013; 60 small tempera paintings, each with its own caption &#x2013; to tackle difficult political subjects, from bias in the criminal justice system to race riots in St. Louis. Many of the panels feel particularly resonant today. (Julia Halperin <i>The Art Newspaper</i>) <br> <br>Since 1941, when the renowned African-American painter Jacob Lawrence unveiled The Migration of the Negro, the 60-panel masterpiece has been divvied up between New York City's Museum of Modern Art and the Philips Collection in Washington, D.C., and has rarely been viewed in its entirety.

It begins with the story of its first purchaser in London in December 1623, and goes on to explore the ways people have interacted with this iconic book over the four hundred years of its history. Throughout the stress is on what we can learn from individual copies now spread around the world about their eventful lives. From ink blots to pet paws, from annotations to wineglass rings, First Folios teem with evidence of their place in different contexts with different priorities. This study offers new ways to understand Shakespeare's reception and the history of the book. Unlike previous scholarly investigations of the First Folio, it is not concerned with the discussions of how the book came into being, the provenance of its texts, or the technicalities of its production. Instead, it reanimates, in narrative style, the histories of this book, paying close attention to the details of individual copies now located around the world - their bindings, marginalia, general condition, sales history, and location - to discuss five major themes: owning, reading, decoding, performing, and perfecting. This is a history of the book that consolidated Shakespeare's posthumous reputation: a reception history and a study of interactions between owners, readers, forgers, collectors, actors, scholars, booksellers, and the book through which we understand and recognize Shakespeare.<br></p><p><br>Emma Smith, <em>Fellow and Tutor in English, Hertford College, University of Oxford</em><br><br>Emma Smith teaches at Hertford College, Oxford, and has published and lectured widely on Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and on the reception of Shakespeare. <br><br>"... offers a wealth of important information, fascinating episodes, and sophisticated critical insight. It will, therefore, be of great interest to a variety of scholars in different disciplines, with literary critics, cultural historians, and scholars of book history foremost among them." --Jos Mara Prez Fernndez, <em>Bulletin of the Comediantes</em><p></p><br>"This book is a very good read, a largely anecdotal but always entertaining account of copies of the Shakespeare First Folio (henceforth FF) from their production in 1623 to the present. ... the pleasure and instruction this book will bring to the casual bibliophile or the Shakespeare enthusiast." --Alan H. Nelson, <em>Renaissance Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Smith's second book, <em>Shakespeare's First Folio: Four Centuries of an Iconic Book</em>, picks up where <em>The Making of Shakespeare's First Folio</em> leaves off, tracing different ways of interacting with the Folio - owning, reading, forging, acting, collecting, and studying - from the seventeenth century to our own time, and from Europe and America to Africa and Asia." --Kevin Curran, <em>Studies in English Literature 1500-1900</em><p></p><br>"a fascinating and provocative book" --Daniel Swift, <em>Spectator</em><p></p><br>"delightful" --Jerry Brotton, <em>The Daily Telegraph</em><p></p><br>"This is a beautifully judged book about books, impeccably researched yet wry and affectionate" --Jerry Brotton, <em>Financial Times</em><p></p><br>"a charming, enlightening account, not so much of the origins, as of the fortunes over the years subsequently, of the great edition" --David Sexton, <em>Evening Standard</em><p></p><br>"Smith's account of the Folio's distinguished career is very nicely written and consistently entertaining and informative ...

It has sold over 400,000 copies, been translated into 17 languages, and sells over 25,000 every year, which is more than any other book on boys in history. To follow up on this first book, which launched the boy's movement, he has now written this revolutionary new book which confronts what he and a lot of other parents and teachers in this country truly believe to be a "boy's crisis". <br> <br> Here are the facts: <ul> <li>Boys today are simply not learning as well as girls</li> <li>Boys receive 70% of the Ds and Fs given all students</li> <li>Boys cause 90% of classroom discipline problems</li> <li>80% of all high school dropouts are boys</li> <li>Millions of American boys are on Ritalin and other mind-bending control drugs</li> <li>Only 40% of college students are boys</li> <li>And three out of four learning disabled students are boys</li> </ul> So what can we do? <p>Gurian has the answer in this enormously fascinating and practical book which shows parents and teachers how to help boys overcome their current classroom obstacles by helping to create the proper learning environment, understand how to help boys work with their unique natural gifts, nurture and expand every bit of their potential, and enabling them to succeed in life the way they ought to.</p> <p>Gurian presents a whole new way of solving the problem based on the success of his program in schools across the country, the latest research and application of neuro-biological research on how boys' brains actually work and how they can learn very well if they're properly taught.</p> <p>Anyone who cares about the future of our boys must read this book.</p></p><p><b>The Key to Unlocking the Minds of Boys</b> <p>There's a crisis in our society that's been developing for years. This crisis has captured the attention of everyone from the parent at the playground to the teacher in your neighborhood classroom to First Lady Laura Bush in the White House. Too many of our boys and young men are falling behind in school and life. Boys receive the majority of the Ds and Fs given all students, and they create 90 percent of classroom discipline problems. Eighty percent of all high school dropouts are boys, millions of American boys are on Ritalin and other drugs, three out of four learning-disabled students are boys, and colleges are struggling to retain male students. This startling trend is not only bad for boys but also for parents, communities, and for humanity's future in general.</p> <p>"Wonderfully readable, The Minds of Boys fills a great void for parents and educators by offering practical ways to change the developmental course for boys at risk. Gurian and Stevens show us that we don't have to surrender our boys to depression or school failure: an essential piece of school reform!"<br> &#x2014;Robin Karr-Morse, author, Ghosts from the Nursery</p> <p>"Michael Gurian and Kathy Stevens pull the pieces together in The Minds of Boys, including the social, emotional, physical, and cognitive needs of boys. This is a must-read for educators from preschool through young adulthood and for any parent or grandparent who is raising a boy. This book is well researched, offering concrete ways to help our boys develop and flourish in and out of school."<br> &#x2014;Dr. Paul D. Slocumb, author, Hear Our Cry: Boys in Crisis</p> <p>"The Minds of Boys is an excellent read. I found it enlightening not only as a neuroscientist but also as the mother of a young boy. It has absolutely changed the way that I think about boys (and men) and the ways in which they express their enthusiasm for life."<br> &#x2014;Tracey J. Shors, Ph.D., Department of Psychology, Center for Collaborative Neuroscience, Rutgers University</p><b><i>The Minds of Boys</i></b> <p>In this fascinating and practical book, Michael Gurian&#x2014;the author of the best-selling <i>The Wonder of Boys</i>&#x2014;and Kathy Stevens show parents and teachers how to help our boys overcome their current classroom obstacles and failures. They offer clear-cut step-by-step guidance to help boys fulfill themselves, use their intelligence, work with their unique natural gifts, expand every bit of their potential, and ultimately succeed in life.</p> <p><b><i>The Minds of Boys</i></b> also presents a scientifically researched, field-tested program for helping boys learn the academic basics: reading, writing, math, and science. Drawing from the latest gender-based brain science and tested by the Gurian Institute and school districts across the United States, Canada, and Australia, the program speaks to specific differences in the way boys and girls learn, the best learning environment for boys' brains, how to help undermotivated and underperforming boys, how to use the arts and athletics to teach boys, how to teach and care for sensitive, aggressive, restless, or bored boys, and how to utilize the option of single-gender education at crucial periods of a son's life.</p> <p><b><i>The Minds of Boys</i></b> emphasizes that our schools cannot fix the problems our boys face without families becoming a centerpiece for the solution. Detailing how parents, extended family, teachers, coaches, and mentors can work together, this proven classroom program can help confront the current crisis in boys' education so that all our sons achieve success in life.</p></p><h2>Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy</h2><p>Shows some signs of wear, and may have some markings on the inside. 100% Money Back .</p><p>GERALD COREY is a Professor Emeritus of Human Services and Counseling at California State University at Fullerton.

It clarifies the experience of being in the midst of change. Unlike many books that presume clarity of foresight or hindsight, the author focuses on the essential uncertainty of participating in evolving events as they happen and considers the creative possibilities of such participation.<br><br>Most methodologies for organizational change are firmly rooted in systems thinking, as are many approaches to process consultation and facilitation. This book questions the suggestion that we can choose and design new futures for our organizations in the way we often hope. Avoiding the widely favoured use of two by two matrices, idealized schemas and simplified typologies that characterize much of the management literature on change, this book encourages the reader to live in the immediate paradoxes and complexities of organizational life, where we must act with intention into the unknowable. The author uses detailed reflective narrative to evoke and elaborate on the experience of participating in the conversational processes of human organizing. It asserts that possibilities are perpetually sustained and changed by the conversational life of organizations.<br><br>This book will be valuable to consultants, managers and leaders, indeed all those who are dissatisfied with idealized models of change and are searching for ways to develop an effective change practice.</p><p>Must of the thinking about orgazational change suggests that we can choose and design new futures for our firms.

Yet few know of his career as a journalist who covered world events from the Great Depression to Vietnam. Now, this distinctive collection offers a portrait of the artist as citizen, deeply engaged in the world around him. In addition to the complete text of Steinbeck's last published book, <b><i>America and Americans</i></b>, this volume brings together for the first time more than fifty of Steinbeck's finest essays and journalistic pieces on Salinas, Sag Harbor, Arthur Miller, Woody Guthrie, the Vietnam War and more. This edition is edited by Steinbeck scholar Susan Shillinglaw and Steinbeck biographer Jackson J. Benson.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><i>America and Americans</i> is a representative, noteworthy collection of John Steinbeck's journalism, including the title piece, actually his last book. Editors Susan Shillinglaw and Jackson J. Benson, who provide an able, informative introduction as well as succinct sectional prefaces, have wisely organized the book thematically rather than chronologically. There are travel pieces (including the hilariously bittersweet "The Making of a New Yorker"); political reflections (including three articles on California migrant workers, written before the last draft of <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>, and a short screed on the spiritual oppression of communism, in which he writes, "Communists of our day are about as revolutionary as the Daughters of the American Revolution"); correspondence from both World War II and Vietnam; and snapshots of Ernie Pyle, Henry Fonda, and other friends. Not all the pieces are timeless, but most are sprinkled with bright gems--"Writers are taken seriously in Italy and are accorded the same respect that Lana Turner's legs get in our country"--and everywhere girded by deep concern and anger about social injustices. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i><p><b>John Steinbeck</b>, born in Salinas, California, in 1902, grew up in a fertile agricultural valley, about twenty-five miles from the Pacific Coast. Both the valley and the coast would serve as settings for some of his best fiction. In 1919 he went to Stanford University, where he intermittently enrolled in literature and writing courses until he left in 1925 without taking a degree. During the next five years he supported himself as a laborer and journalist in New York City, all the time working on his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Cup of Gold</i>&nbsp;(1929).<br> &nbsp;<br> After marriage and a move to Pacific Grove, he published two California books,&nbsp;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i>&nbsp;(1932) and&nbsp;<i>To a God Unknown</i>&nbsp;(1933), and worked on short stories later collected in&nbsp;<i>The Long Valley</i>&nbsp;(1938). Popular success and financial security came only with&nbsp;<i>Tortilla Flat</i>&nbsp;(1935), stories about Monterey&#x2019;s paisanos. A ceaseless experimenter throughout his career, Steinbeck changed courses regularly. Three powerful novels of the late 1930s focused on the California laboring class:&nbsp;<i>In Dubious Battle</i>&nbsp;(1936),&nbsp;<i>Of Mice and Men</i>&nbsp;(1937), and the book considered by many his finest,&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1939).&nbsp;<i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1939.<br> &nbsp;<br> Early in the 1940s, Steinbeck became a filmmaker with&nbsp;<i>The Forgotten Village</i>&nbsp;(1941) and a serious student of marine biology with&nbsp;<i>Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1941). He devoted his services to the war, writing Bombs Away (1942) and the controversial play-novelette&nbsp;<i>The Moon is Down</i>&nbsp;(1942).<i>Cannery Row</i>&nbsp;(1945),&nbsp;<i>The Wayward Bus</i>&nbsp;(1948), another experimental drama,&nbsp;<i>Burning Bright</i>(1950), and&nbsp;<i>The Log from the Sea of Cortez</i>&nbsp;(1951) preceded publication of the monumental&nbsp;<i>East of Eden</i>&nbsp;(1952), an ambitious saga of the Salinas Valley and his own family&#x2019;s history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last decades of his life were spent in New York City and Sag Harbor with his third wife, with whom he traveled widely. Later books include&nbsp;<i>Sweet Thursday</i>&nbsp;(1954),&nbsp;<i>The Short Reign of Pippin IV: A Fabrication</i>&nbsp;(1957),&nbsp;<i>Once There Was a War</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The Winter of Our Discontent&nbsp;</i>(1961),<i>Travels with Charley in Search of America</i>&nbsp;(1962),&nbsp;<i>America and Americans</i>&nbsp;(1966), and the posthumously published&nbsp;<i>Journal of a Novel: The East of Eden Letters</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Viva Zapata!</i>(1975),&nbsp;<i>The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights</i>&nbsp;(1976), and&nbsp;<i>Working Days: The Journals of The Grapes of Wrath</i>&nbsp;(1989).<br> &nbsp;<br> Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, and, in 1964, he was presented with the United States Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Steinbeck died in New York in 1968. Today, more than thirty years after his death, he remains one of America's greatest writers and cultural figures.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Jackson J.

This classic tale takes place in southwest England and follows the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, who are reduced to meager means when their father passes and entrusts his fortune to their half brother, John. Now available as part of the Word Cloud Classics series, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, a story of love, romance, and heartache, is a must-have addition to the libraries of all classic literature lovers.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br><br>About the Word Cloud Classics series:<br><br>Classic works of literature with a clean, modern aesthetic! Perfect for both old and new literature fans, the Word Cloud&nbsp;Classics series from Canterbury Classics provides a chic and inexpensive introduction to timeless tales. With a higher production value, including heat burnished covers and foil stamping, these eye-catching, easy-to-hold editions are the perfect gift for students and fans of literature everywhere.</p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel. This edition, first published in 2006, follows the second edition of 1813, which corrects errors of the first edition.</p><h2>Pagan Portals - Brigid: Meeting The Celtic Goddess Of Poetry, Forge, And Healing Well</h2><p>Pagan Portals - Brigid is a basic introduction to the Goddess Brigid focusing on her history and myth as well as her modern devotion and worship.

At the same time, Wisse draws attention to the precarious conditions that call Jewish humor into being--and the price it may exact from its practitioners and audience.</p><br><p> Wisse broadly traces modern Jewish humor around the world, teasing out its implications as she explores memorable and telling examples from German, Yiddish, English, Russian, and Hebrew. Among other topics, the book looks at how Jewish humor channeled Jewish learning and wordsmanship into new avenues of creativity, brought relief to liberal non-Jews in repressive societies, and enriched popular culture in the United States.</p><br><p> Even as it invites readers to consider the pleasures and profits of Jewish humor, the book asks difficult but fascinating questions: Can the excess and extreme self-ridicule of Jewish humor go too far and backfire in the process? And is "leave 'em laughing" the wisest motto for a people that others have intended to sweep off the stage of history?</p></p><p><p>"Ruth Wisse's electrifying undressing of Jewish wit catapults us well past Freud's far more inhibited perceptions and into the naked precincts of tragic insight. Riffing through the laughter thrown up by the interpenetrations of language, history, and the political culture of variegated societies, Wisse uncovers subversion, paradox, fright, anger, grief, and the often defeated imagination of reversal. Tickle the funny bone long enough, she warns, and hilarity will expose dread. This stirringly original study of Jewish joking reveals the darker irony that underlies the comedic ironies of the Jewish mind at play."<b>--Cynthia Ozick</b></p><p>"One of the most interesting and insightful books about comedy I've ever read. I learned a lot, and I laughed a lot."<b>--B. J. Novak, writer and actor, <i>The Office</i></b></p><p>"This is a wise and witty book, and a necessary one, too, because Jewish humor hasn't always received the commentary and analysis it deserves. Almost every page of this fine new work offers something to learn from or laugh about--or both."<b>--William Novak, coeditor of <i>The Big Book of Jewish Humor</i></b></p><p>"The funniest thing since we let the goyim into show business."<b>--David Mamet</b></p><p>"It's a treat. The jokes are abundant, well chosen, and funny; and Ruth Wisse brings Harvard scholarship to our wonderful Yiddish treasury of humor. A salute and congratulations to Professor Wisse."<b>--Herman Wouk</b></p><p>"An essential examination of Jewish humor. Ruth Wisse ably traces the subject through high literature and low culture, from Heine to <i>Borat</i>, offering new and glimmering insights in each case. She takes on the difficult questions, not least the one of utility: has humor helped the Jews, and does it help them still? <i>No Joke</i> is vastly erudite, deeply informative, and delightfully written--plus it's got plenty of good jokes. What more could one ask for?"<b>--Jeremy Dauber, Columbia University</b></p><p>"<i>No Joke</i> is both an anthology and running interpretation of Jewish humor. Ruth Wisse provides original treatments of Heine, Kafka, Sholem Aleichem, Israel Zangwill, Leonard Q. Ross (Leo Rosten), Sh. Y. Agnon, and Philip Roth, among many others. In an age of books that cover four or five disparate figures and call themselves wide-ranging, <i>No Joke</i> is a return to the ambition of comprehensiveness and to the confidence that scholarship might appeal to the common educated reader. I can't recommend the book more highly."<b>--D. G. Myers, Ohio State University</b></p><b>Ruth R.

After having published a facsimile of this extraordinary work in 1987, we are proud to offer it this year in paperback at an affordable price. For over ten years, Miro, the Spanish artist, and Paul Eluard, whose text was inspired by Catalan Spain, worked together to create a unique book: in their own words, a masterpiece of &#34;Plastic harmony.&#34; Printed in pure, dazzling colors, Miro&#39;s characteristic amorphous forms invite the viewer to skip from text to imagery almost interchangeably, giving marvelous new life and meaning to Eluard&#39;s poetry as well as creating a book that is in itself a sculptural entity. Its title roughly translatable as &#34;Ready for Anything, &#34; A Toute Epreuve achieves Miro&#39;s own ambition for the project, stated in 1948: &#34;I hope to create something sensational.&#34;</p><p>This title in the Modern Masters series focuses on the work of Joan Miro, one of the painters most often associated with surrealism. Miro studied art in his native Barcelona before joining the Paris art scene in the 1920s. Fantasy, dreams, and myths played an important role in Miro&#39;s early works, many of which are included in the more than 70 full-color reproductions of paintings, sculptures, and tapestries in this collection. This is a fine introduction to the monumental works of one of the foremost artists of the 20th century.Janis Mink studied art history at Smith College and gained her doctorate in Hamburg under Martin Warnke.

Written by D�rer in 1525.<br></p><p>Albrecht D�rer (German: 21 May 1471 &#x2013; 6 April 1528) was a German painter, engraver, printmaker, mathematician, and theorist from Nuremberg. His high-quality woodcuts (nowadays often called Meisterstiche or "master prints") established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, and he has been conventionally regarded as the greatest artist of the Northern Renaissance ever since. His vast body of work includes altarpieces and religious works, numerous portraits and self-portraits, and copper engravings. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known prints include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. D�rer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.</p><h2>Analyzing Multivariate Data (with CD-ROM) (Duxbury Applied Series)</h2><p>Offering the latest teaching and practice of applied multivariate statistics, this text is perfect for students who need an applied introduction to the subject.

Crosby looks at hard, accurate throwing and the manipulation of fire as unique human capabilities. Humans began throwing rocks in prehistory and then progressed to javelins, atlatls, bows and arrows. We learned to make fire by friction and used it to cook, drive game, burn out rivals, and alter landscapes to our liking. Our exploitation of these two capabilities figured in the extinction of many species, and may have played a role in the demise of Neanderthals. In historic times we invented catapults, trebuchets, and such flammable liquids as Greek Fire, a napalm-like substance that stuck to whatever it hit and could not be extinguished with water. About 1,000 years ago we invented gunpowder, which led to guns and rockets, enabling us to literally throw fire. Gunpowder weaponry accelerated the rise of empires and the advance of European imperialism. In the 20th century, gunpowder weaponry enabled us to achieve unprecedented mayhem--the most destructive wars of all time. This trend peaked at the end of World War II with the V-2 and atomic bomb, at which point species suicide became possible. Faced with possible extinction should we experience World War III, we have turned our projectile talents to space travel which may make it possible for our species to migrate to other bodies of our solar system and even other star systems. Alfred W. Crosby is the author of the widely popular and ground-breaking books The Measure of Reality (Cambridge, 1996), America&#39;s Forgotten Pandemic (Cambridge, 1990) and Ecological Imperialism (Cambridge, 1986). He taught at the University of Texas, Austin for over 20 years. His books have received the Ralph Waldo Emerson Prize, the Medical Writers Association Prize and been named by the Los Angeles Times as among the best books of the year.</p><p>In Throwing Fire, historian Alfred W. Crosby looks at hard, accurate throwing and the manipulation of fire as unique human capabilities, allowing us to create simple weapons, atomic bombs, and to venture into space. He examines the effects of throwing fire on life on our planet, including species extinctions, the rise of empires and the advance of European Imperialism, and the peril of destructive wars. Throwing fire, which might make Earth uninhabitable for humans, may make it possible for our species to migrate to other bodies of our solar system and even other star systems.Alfred W. Crosby is Professor Emeritus in American Studies, History, and Geography at the University of Texas, Austin, where he taught for more than 20 years.

The reported sudden jumps of CO2 in Greenland ice cores stimulated him to put this interest into conjunction with his oceanographic interests. The result was a surprising and important calculation. The key was what Broecker later described as a &#34;great conveyor belt&#39;&#34;of seawater carrying heat northward. . . . The energy carried to the neighborhood of Iceland was &#34;staggering,&#34; Broecker realized, nearly a third as much as the Sun sheds upon the entire North Atlantic. If something were to shut down the conveyor, climate would change across much of the Northern Hemisphere... There was reason to believe a shutdown could happen swiftly. In many regions the consequences for climate would be spectacular. Broecker was foremost in taking this disagreeable news to the public. In 1987 he wrote that we had been treating the greenhouse effect as a &#39;cocktail hour curiosity, &#39; but now &#39;we must view it as a threat to human beings and wildlife.&#39; The climate system was a capricious beast, he said, and we were poking it with a sharp stick.Spencer R.

Around this supremely simple story, V. S. Naipaul builds one of the few virtually perfect novels in our language, a book that is--in the balance struck between its small incidents and its large, overarching patterns, in the ironic beauty of its prose--at once compelling, mysterious, and classical. It is also one of the few novels in any language that transcned their own genre. By the end of A House for Mr. Biswas we are reading not only a tragicomic masterpiece of social manners in a postcolonial society but a tremendous parable about the individual self in its enslavement to time and change, and in its search for freedom.&nbsp;</p></p><p>"Naipaul has constructed a marvelous prose epic that matches the best nineteenth-century novels for richness of comic insight and final, tragic power."&#x2013;<i>Newsweek</i>Introduction by Karl Miller</p><h2>Larousse Advanced French-English/English-French Dictionary</h2><p>Completely updated!

Hanson, Heath, and Thornton point to academics themselves -- their careerist ambitions, incessant self-promotion, and overspecialized scholarship, among other things -- as the progenitors of the crisis. They call for a return to academic populism, an approach characterized by accessible, unspecialized writing, selfless commitment to students and teaching, and respect for the legacy of freedom and democracy that the ancients bequeathed to the West.</p><p>&#x201c;Professors Hanson, Heath and Thornton have written a set of powerful essays that combine scholarship, passion and wit in a devastating critique of the errors and sins that have brought the condition of the humanities low in America&#x2019;s colleges and universities. They take on the elite rulers of what has become a shrinking and increasingly embattled kingdom with a vigor and zeal that embody the power latent in studies that are truly humanistic. Their assaults resemble the attacks made by the humanists of the Renaissance against the scholastic pettifoggers of their day and, in time, are bound to win a similar victory.&#x201d;&#x2014;Donald Kagan, Hillhouse Professor of History and Classics, Yale University &#x201c;The true enemies of the Humanities are an unholy alliance between the tenured ideological dictatorship of deconstructive Leftists and the corporate-managerial mentality of fat overpaid administrators. Hanson, Heath, and Thornton are resolved to give these nefarious forces a run for their money. What makes this book genuinely splendid is that its authors know where to start: in Classical Antiquity, the indispensable foundation for any education that wants to see young minds growing into their full human potential.&#x201d;&#x2014;Virgil Nemoianu, William J Byron Distinguished Professor of Literature and Ordinary Professor of Philosophy, Catholic University of America Classical studies, once considered the foundation of all higher learning, is today nearly moribund. Students&#x2014;and the general public&#x2014;seem no longer interested in what the Greeks and Romans did or what they had to say. They certainly have no expectation of discovering wisdom in our classical past. The rejection of the relevance of the past, moreover, has increasingly spread throughout the humanities. Why is this occurring? And does it matter? Though many have sought to explain, or explain away, the problems of contemporary higher education, and the humanities in particular, few authors have examined the problem as deeply or as thoroughly as have Victor Davis Hanson, John Heath, and Bruce S. Thornton, well-known classicists and the acclaimed authors of such books as Who Killed Homer? and Plagues of the Mind. No one has explained so well, as these authors, the crucial linkages between the discipline of classics and modern Western civilization. They demonstrate here that no one can understand, much less hope to defend, the modern West without a thorough grounding in the classical authors and ideas that were its progenitors. In Bonfire of the Humanities: Rescuing the Classics in an Impoverished Age, Hanson, Heath, and Thornton begin by unsparingly documenting the degeneration of classics. They also reveal the root causes of this decline. They point to the academics themselves&#x2014;their careerist ambitions, incessant self-promotion, and overspecialized, inaccessible work, among other things&#x2014;as the source of the crisis, and call for a return to &#x201c;academic populism,&#x201d; an approach characterized by accessible, graceful writing, selfless commitment to students and teaching, and respect for the legacy of freedom and democracy that the ancients bequeathed to the West. Subsequent chapters detail the betrayal of classics by classicists, including chapters discussing the hypocrisy of Professor Martha Nussbaum&#x2019;s attempt to justify the radicalization of classical studies, the self-indulgent careerism of humanities professors, the solipsistic narcissism of recent academic work in classics, the postmodernist contradictions and inanities now plaguing classical studies, and the disappearance of the disinterested humanities professor. An epilogue reviews the hilariously bizarre (but disturbing) &#x201c;Unabomber episode,&#x201d; in which authors Hanson and Heath were turned in as potential Unabomber suspects by one of their feminist colleagues. Hanson, Heath, and Thornton write in a style that is as illuminating as it is engaging. No one who reads this book will be able to deny the seriousness of the crisis in classics and the humanities at large; it will be equally impossible to deny the cultural significance of this crisis. Fortunately, the authors lay out detailed proposals to arrest the decline in humane learning. These proposals, and especially their call for professors to embrace academic populism, merit a fair and widespread hearing. Bonfire of the Humanities should be read by anyone interested in a sophisticated yet accessible analysis of the root problems affecting academia and the necessary measures to effect recovery.Victor Davis Hanson is Professor of Greek and Director of the Classics Program at California State University, Fresno.

No dry corporate history, Henry and Edsel focuses on the epic battle of wills between the unyielding Henry Ford, his gifted son Edsel, and his "second son," the brutal and insidious Harry Bennet who rose from barroom brawler to become Henry's heir apparent. Bak dispels the common misperception of Edsel Ford as a weak and ineffectual manager, and explains that it was in fact Edsel's level-headedness and imaginative business solutions and that allowed the company to survive the many challenges to its survival in the first half of the twentieth century. Timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary celebration of Ford Motor Company, Henry and Edsel is sure to be warmly received by history buffs and business readers.<br> Richard Bak (Detroit, MI) is a veteran journalist who has written widely on the Fords and the automobile industry.</p><p>One hundred years after a rawboned mechanical genius transformed his vision of "a car for the masses" into one of the world&#x2019;s first major automobile manufacturers, a great story remains to be told. It is a multigenerational saga of fathers and sons and the epic struggle for control of an industrial empire. <p>Henry and Edsel is the first biography to focus on both the legendary founder of the Ford Motor Company and the son who led the company&#x2019;s transformation from successful manufacturer to business empire. Author Richard Bak offers a daring new perspective on the human drama that changed the shape of Ford. He examines the ongoing friction between Henry and Edsel over adapting to a changing competitive environment and lays bare the stark contrasts between the two men&#x2013;both their personalities and their approach to the design, construction, and marketing of automobiles.</p> <p>In these pages, Henry Ford emerges as a complex and self-contradictory man who was not entirely comfortable in the new world that he had done so much to create. Renowned as an innovator, he resisted desperately needed changes in his own company&#x2013;everything from painting cars any color other than black to providing financing for car buyers. A self-styled friend of the working man, he despised labor unions and appointed the ruthless Henry Bennett to squash any hint of unionization at Ford.</p> <p>Among the many surprises in this fascinating exploration of the ultimate family business run by the quintessential business family is its portrait of Edsel Ford. Often viewed as a weak and ineffectual manager, Edsel is revealed as a gifted, levelheaded, and imaginative businessman with a keen sense of where the market was headed. When the company&#x2019;s very survival was at stake during the tumultuous 1920s and 1930s, it was Edsel who envisioned and pushed for the daring changes that turned Ford into a powerful, modern corporation.</p> <p>Another compelling character in this classic American story is Henry Bennett, often referred to as Ford&#x2019;s second son. A hard-drinking barroom brawler in his youth, Bennett rose through sheer toughness and force of will to become Henry Ford&#x2019;s heir apparent. The climactic struggle among these three very different men to control the vast and growing Ford empire was one of the most dramatic conflicts in the history of American business.</p> <p>Complete with compelling portraits of important Ford competitors, executives, and family members, as well as a fascinating array of family and official company photos, Henry and Edsel is must reading for anyone interested in business, the auto industry, or the fascinating world of the early twentieth century.</p>An Epic Battle of Generations <p>It is commonly believed that Henry Ford was a dynamic, innovative visionary who ran his company with an iron hand and an eye to the future&#x2013;while his son Edsel was a weak, if dutiful, heir and an uninspired manager, who followed his father&#x2019;s orders. Henry and Edsel, the first biography to focus on both father and son, turns that common belief on its ear.</p> <p>Offering a daring new perspective on the human drama that changed the shape of Ford Motor company, author Richard Bak explores the ongoing friction between Henry and Edsel over adapting to a changing competitive environment and lays bare the stark contrasts between the two men.

Contrary to time-honored intuition, the mind turns out to be a complex of brain functions. And contrary to the wishful thinking of some philosophers, there is no stemming the revolutionary impact that brain research will have on our understanding of how the mind works.</p><p><i>Brain-Wise</i> is the sequel to Patricia Smith Churchland's <i>Neurophilosophy</i>, the book that launched a subfield. In a clear, conversational manner, this book examines old questions about the nature of the mind within the new framework of the brain sciences. What, it asks, is the neurobiological basis of consciousness, the self, and free choice? How does the brain learn about the external world and about its own introspective world? What can neurophilosophy tell us about the basis and significance of religious and moral experiences?</p><p>Drawing on results from research at the neuronal, neurochemical, system, and whole-brain levels, the book gives an up-to-date perspective on the state of neurophilosophy&#x2015;what we know, what we do not know, and where things may go from here.</p></p><p>Patricia S.

Control freaks. Narcissists. Slackers. Cynics. Their outbursts, irrational demands, gripes, and countless other disruptions need to be dealt with, and you are the unlucky one with that job description. But every manager has to deal with these people. What separates the great managers is their ability to turn them into productive team players.Leading the Unleadable turns this seemingly difficult chore into a straight-forward process that gently, yet effectively, improves behaviors. And it begins with understanding a core truth: most people actually want to contribute results, not cause headaches. When the manager resets to that fundamental principle, the potential for change can reveal itself in even the most hopeless situations.

M. Cornford showed that the remarkable burst of abstract speculation among pre-Socratic thinkers of the sixth century B.C. emerged directly from the religious thought of the preceding era in Greece. Combining profound classical scholarship with striking anthropological and sociological insight, Cornford rejected the post-Darwinian rationalist assumption that religion and philosophy are fundamentally different from each other. His book supplies a needed reminder of the intricate connections between critical scientific thought and social and emotional experience. As he probes the mythic antecedents of such persistent metaphysical concepts as Destiny, God, Soul, Substance, Nature, and Immortality, Cornford warns us that "unless we have some grasp of that history [of myth], we are not likely to understand the speculation, which, however scientific its spirit may be, constantly operates with these religious ideas, and is to a large extent confined in its movement within the limits already traced by them." Classicists, historians of religion, students of ancient history, and everyone concerned with the subject of myth will find this lucid and highly original work to be a source of rich insights about the organic nature and continuity of Western thought.</p></p><p>The late F.M.

In the chapters that follow, Davids embarks upon a theological reading of each letter informed by its social-rhetorical understanding&#x2015;what they meant in the context of their original cultural settings&#x2015;including: a survey of recent scholarship, a discussion of relevant introductory issues, a thematic commentary, a treatment of important theological themes, and a discussion of the place of the letter in the biblical canon and its contribution to New Testament theology.</p><p>The Biblical Theology of the New Testament (BTNT) series provides upper college and seminary-level textbooks for students of New Testament theology, interpretation, and exegesis.

I was unsure what it would be or when it would happen, but I knew it was my calling. I also knew it would change the way people looked at the topic and that it would eventually spread worldwide. When it occurred, the development of FST felt like a combination of divine guidance and pure necessity.<br><br> FST has been a blessing beyond words. People may question why I would want to teach a technique I had developed and lose the exclusivity of being the only person to offer it. My response has always been that when we are given a gift it is our responsibility to give back. How could I not share something that has brought so much joy and hope to myself and so many others?&nbsp;<br><br> From age of 4 until I was 40, I spent my life in a dance studio. I was both dancing professionally and teaching from the young age of 14. Movement and the wonder of the body have been a part of my daily life for a very long time. My other passion was the science of the human body. I took every course offered on the subject in school and read as much as I could about it. In high school, I distinctly remember going home and learning all 206 bones in one evening.&nbsp;<br><br> I spent many years training dancers in flexibility and not one was ever injured on my watch. I attributed it to the focus in my classes on extensive flexibility training to which I dedicated at least 30 minutes during the warm-up component in each class. In the dance world, extreme flexibility along with strength is a non-negotiable requirement.&nbsp;<br><br> While teaching a group stretch class at a local gym, I had an epiphany. I looked out over my class, which was filled to capacity, and realized that there was a great need in people to become more flexible, indeed senior citizens made a big chunk of the class. This new awareness of the general population needing and, more importantly, wanting help with their flexibility was eye opening and very exciting. My vision was becoming clearer once I enrolled at Arizona State University (ASU), getting my degree and studying Academic dance with a focus in kinesiology.&nbsp;<br><br> As life would have it, at the end of one of my first stretch classes, a guy came up to me and said, "They need what you are doing here at the ASU athletic department."&nbsp;<br> It was an opportunity to work with college athletes from 26 different sports.&nbsp;<br><br> The journey of creating Fascial Stretch Therapy began in the summer of 1995 in the weight training room at ASU. It occurred on the bench press when I tied a weight belt around a football player's leg to hold it still while I stretched him. I realized that if I could get proper leverage on this big guy by getting him up off the floor and using a stabilizing strap, I was truly on to something. And the rest, as they say, is history. Each time I had someone on the treatment table in my private practice, I developed the new method a bit more. Between my studies and my private practice I was working upwards of 18 hours a day. I was on the football field in the morning taking the team through group stretches or in the weight room working with individual athletes. I worked for several hours before class and then again after class each afternoon. I would then go to my office and spend time honing the art of my newfound career. It was not unusual for me to spend ten hours a day stretching individual clients.<br><br> My hard work paid off quickly - I was asked to travel with the 1996 US men's Olympic Wrestling team. They say if you are living your life's calling, things begin to flow and drop into place and they certainly were! I was the first flexibility specialist to be a part of the Olympic games.&nbsp;<br><br> I knew I would need someone to take care of my clients while I was away for the summer so I found two young people who were interested to learn the technique I had developed. I trained them privately and they became the first two FST students as well as my beginning staff. While my company's name started out as A&amp;F Flexibility Systems, we soon changed it to the Stretch to Win Center based in Tempe, Arizona, USA.<br><br> I had a thriving practice for almost 20 years and enjoyed working with clients from many walks of life. A large percentage of my clientele were professional American football players. From 2005-2009 I was fortunate enough to be part of three Super Bowls taking care of almost the entire starting lineup for three different teams.&nbsp;<br><br> It became increasingly clear that there was a growing need to develop the school and that it was time for me to end the chapter of private practice and give it my full attention to teaching others. We closed our office in 2012 to dedicate ourselves to sharing our knowledge of FST with as many as possible. This was accomplished through our professional training school, the Stretch to Win Institute.<br><br> The other serendipitous event in my life was to meet Chris, my husband, partner and the love of my life. He has been by my side since the day he walked through my office door in June 1998. Joining creative forces early in FST's genesis allowed Chris and I to evolve and develop the technique together. I choose not to speculate what my life or FST would be like without him.

Managerial flexibility to adapt and revise future decisions in order to capitalize on favorable future opportunities or to limit losses has proven vital to long-term corporate success in an uncertain and changing marketplace. In this book Lenos Trigeorgis, who has helped shape the field of real options, brings together a wealth of previously scattered knowledge and research on the new flexibility in corporate resource allocation and in the evaluation of investment alternatives brought about by the shift from static cash-flow approaches to the more dynamic paradigm of real options&#x2015;an approach that incorporates decisions on whether to defer, expand, contract, abandon, switch use, or otherwise alter a capital investment. Comprehensive in scope, Real Options reviews current techniques of capital budgeting and details an approach (based on the pricing of options) that provides a means of quantifying the elusive elements of managerial flexibility in the face of unexpected changes in the market. Also discussed are the strategic value of new technology, project interdependence, and competitive interaction. The ability to value real options has so dramatically altered the way in which corporate resources are allocated that future textbooks on capital budgeting will bear little resemblance to those of even the recent past. Real Options is a pioneer in this area, coupling a coherent picture of how option theory is used with practical insights in into real-world applications.</p></p><p>Lenos Trigeorgis is the Bank of Cyprus Chair Professor of Finance in the School of Economics and Management at the University of Cyprus and Professor of Finance at King's College of the University of London.

UP.</p><p>Since the fall of Communism in Russia, the Kremlin archives have yielded a hitherto hidden history of the Soviet regime. Richard Pipes, emeritus professor of Russian history at Harvard and author of <i>Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime</i>, is the principal editor of this first collection of secret Lenin papers published in English. The collection reveals sides of the Bolshevik leader long guessed at in the West but never proven, particularly his efforts to subvert the West. Such revelations make this volume an invaluable historical tool that helps part the Iron Curtain of silence and disinformation.Lenin - the man, the revolutionary, and the world leader - has remained an enigma, part myth arising from the tumult of the Russian Revolution and part image carefully controlled for nearly seventy years by the leaders of the Soviet Union and their sympathizers abroad. The Unknown Lenin, containing long concealed documents from the Soviet archives, helps correct the myth and revise the image. Lenin emerges here as a ruthless, manipulative leader who used terror, subversion, and persecution to achieve his goals.</p><h2>Grant Seeking in an Electronic Age</h2><p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p> <b>This guide teaches students and professionals a systematic process for researching, designing, writing, and submitting successful grant-seeking proposals. </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Focusing on proposals submitted for government, foundation, and corporation funding, <i>Grant Seeking in an Electronic Age </i>leads the reader through a six-step grant-seeking process, from researching potential funders, to designing, writing and submitting a proposal that follows the funder's guidelines.

The collisions produce a plasma of quarks and gluons in a sizable volume, with a density greater than that in a neutron star and with a temperature 100 000 times that in the Sun's core. These conditions match those a few microseconds after the big bang beginning of the universe. In our normal low-energy world, quarks and gluons are always locked up inside the confines of particles such as protons and neutrons.

When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here.

So wrote George Eliot of Romola, the novel which argues her most profound and utopian vision of the position of women. Romola&#39;s patient subservience to her scholar-father Bardo, her unhappy marriage to supple and treacherous Tito, and her passionate intellectual and spiritual awakening take place in Renaissance Florence which, like Victorian Britain, was caught up in a period of ferment and transition. Romola appeared in 1862-3 to high praise by Victorians from Tennyson and Trollope to Henry James, and discerning modern readers will recognize it as George Eliot&#39;s first mature masterpiece. In her introduction to this new edition, Dorothea Barrett explores the issues of gender and learning, desire and scholarship, and the interweaving of history and fiction which she identifies at the centre of the novel.George Eliot&#39;s Romola, writes Robert Kiely in his Introduction, embodies the author&#39;s &#34;wrestling with her own best theories of history and human nature as a creative experiment of the highest order.&#34; Set in Florence in 1492, a time of great political and religious turmoil, Eliot&#39;s novel blends vivid fictional characters with historical figures such as Savonarola, Machiavelli, and the Medicis. When Romola, the virtuous daughter of a blind scholar, marries Tito Melema, a charismatic young Greek, she is bound to a man whose escalating betrayals threaten to destroy all that she holds dear. Profoundly inspired by Savonarola&#39;s teachings, then crushed by the religious leader&#39;s ultimate failure, Romola finds her salvation in noble self-sacrifice.

It was a trying time, however, for many Americans, including women who fought for the vote, blacks who began organizing to secure their rights, and activists on the Left who lost theirs in the first Red Scare of the century.<br><br> John Cooper's panoramic history of this period shows us where we came from and sheds light on where we are.</p><p>John Milton Cooper, Jr., is the author of the acclaimed dual biography of Roosevelt and Wilson, The Warrior and the Priest. He is William Frances Allen Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin.In a richly textured narrative, Cooper describes political, economic, social and diplomatic developments in the United States during the first two decades of the century, an era dominated by two dynamic presidents: Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. The period witnessed America's involvement in WW I, the building of the Panama Canal, the invention of the airplane and the radio, mass production of automobiles, the first civil rights organizations, women's suffrage, the inauguration of income tax, and the emergence of mass journalism, professional sports and movie stars. Cooper ( The Warrior and the Priest ) delineates the opposing stands taken by major political parties on economic and social issues, and traces the prolonged debate over international activism versus isolationism.

He is also married to the very rich, very beautiful, and utterly amoral Deborah Caughlin Kelly. But one night, in the prime of his existence, he hears the moon talking to him on the terrace of a fashionable New York high-rise, and it is urging him to kill himself. It is almost as a defense against that infinitely seductive voice that Rojack murders his wife.In this wild battering ram of a novel, which was originally published to vast controversy in 1965, Norman Mailer creates a character who might be a fictional precursor of the philosopher-killer he would later profile in <i>The Executioner's Song</i>. As Rojack runs amok through the city in which he was once a privileged citizen, Mailer peels away the layers of our social norms to reveal a world of pure appetite and relentless cruelty. Sensual, horrifying, and informed by a vision that is one part Nietzsche, one part de Sade, and one part Charlie Parker, <i>An American Dream </i>grabs the reader by the throat and refuses to let go.</p><p><b>Norman Mailer</b> was born in 1923 in Long Branch, New Jersey, and grew up in Brooklyn, New York.

In this profound and considered work, he offers a radical new way to look at the gospels today as he shows just how deeply Jewish the Christian Gospels are and how much they reflect the Jewish scriptures, history, and patterns of worship. Pulling back the layers of a long-standing Gentile ignorance, he reveals how the church&#x2019;s literal reading of the Bible is so far removed from these original Jewish authors&#x2019; intent that it is an act of heresy.</p><p>Using the Gospel of Matthew as a guide, Spong explores the Bible&#x2019;s literary and liturgical roots&#x2014;its grounding in Jewish culture, symbols, icons, and storytelling tradition&#x2014;to explain how the events of Jesus&#x2019; life, including the virgin birth, the miracles, the details of the passion story, and the resurrection and ascension, would have been understood by both the Jewish authors of the various gospels and by the Jewish audiences for which they were originally written. Spong makes clear that it was only after the church became fully Gentile that readers of the Gospels took these stories to be factual, distorting their original meaning.</p><p>In <em>Biblical Literalism: A Gentile Heresy</em>, Spong illuminates the gospels as never before and provides a better blueprint for the future than where the church&#x2019;s leaden and heretical reading of the story of Jesus has led us&#x2014;one that allows the faithful to live inside the Christian story in the modern world.</p></p><p><p>John Shelby Spong, the Episcopal Bishop of Newark before his retirement in 2000, has been a visiting lecturer at Harvard and at more than 500 other universities all over the world.

On the other, neglect results when we consider the law obsolete, no longer carrying any normative power (tassels on clothing, making sacrifices). Even readers who do attempt to make use of the Old Testament "law" often find it either irrelevant, hopelessly laden with "thou shalt nots," or simply so confusing that they throw up their hands in despair. Despite these extremes, people continue to propose moral principles from these laws as "the biblical view" and to garner proof texts to resolve issues that arise in society. The result is that both Christians and skeptics regularly abuse the Torah, and its true message often lies unheard. Walton and Walton offer in <em>The Lost World of the Torah</em> a restorative vision of the ancient genre of <em>instruction for wisdom</em> that makes up a significant portion of the Old Testament. In the ancient Near East, order was achieved through the wisdom of those who governed society. The objective of torah was to teach the Israelites to be wise about the kind of order needed to receive the blessings of God&#x2019;s favor and presence within the context of the covenant. Here readers will find fresh insight on this fundamental genre of the Old Testament canon.</p><p>John H. Walton (PhD, Hebrew Union College) is professor of Old Testament at Wheaton College and Graduate School. His many books include <em>The Lost World of Genesis One</em> and <em>The Lost World of Adam and Eve</em>.<br><br>J. Harvey Walton (MA, Wheaton College Graduate School) is a researcher in biblical studies and has contributed to a variety of publications. He is pursuing graduate studies at St. Andrews University."Walton and Walton take recent scholarship on ancient Near Eastern law and apply it with great dexterity to their investigation of the biblical Torah. Ancient law codes, like the Laws of Hammurabi, very likely did not form the actual law of their respective societies, and this book is willing to face the implications of this honestly. Overall, it builds a careful and important argument for how to approach biblical law. And it is brave enough to show that most casual interpretations by modern Christians will almost inevitably go awry. One can only hope that this kind of work will begin to dampen the naive and simplistic readings that plague much of American Protestantism today." (Bruce Wells, associate professor, department of Middle Eastern studies, University of Texas at Austin)<br><br>"Walton and Walton rightly view Torah in the broader context of wisdom and as an expression of wisdom. This is exactly what passages such as Deuteronomy 4:6 and Psalm 19:7 imply." (Kevin Chen, associate professor of biblical studies, Union University)<br><br>"Walton and Walton continue their Lost World series with a study of Torah, understood as instruction rather than law, wisdom rather than legislation. They point out how Torah is often misunderstood by Christians because they assume that it functions like modern laws or Greco-Roman laws. Instead, the authors argue, the Torah should be interpreted in its ancient Near Eastern context, where order was achieved through the wisdom of those who governed society. The collections of 'laws' contained selected illustrations, intended to teach a model for right and wrong as guidance for judges but were not comprehensive legal codes that regulated everyday life in detail. This careful and readable study will be valuable for all who are interested in Old Testament law and its relevance for Christians today." (David L. Baker, All Nations Christian College)</p><h2>Liberty or Death: The French Revolution</h2><p><b>A strikingly new account of the impact of the French Revolution in Paris, across the French countryside, and around the globe</b><br><br> The French Revolution has fascinated, perplexed, and inspired for more than two centuries. It was a seismic event that radically transformed France and launched shock waves across the world. In this provocative new history, Peter McPhee draws on a lifetime&#x2019;s study of eighteenth-century France and Europe to create an entirely fresh account of the world&#x2019;s first great modern revolution&#x2014;its origins, drama, complexity, and significance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Was the Revolution a major turning point in French&#x2014;even world&#x2014;history, or was it instead a protracted period of violent upheaval and warfare that wrecked millions of lives? McPhee evaluates the Revolution within a genuinely global context: Europe, the Atlantic region, and even farther. He acknowledges the key revolutionary events that unfolded in Paris, yet also uncovers the varying experiences of French citizens outside the gates of the city: the provincial men and women whose daily lives were altered&#x2014;or not&#x2014;by developments in the capital. Enhanced with evocative stories of those who struggled to cope in unpredictable times, McPhee&#x2019;s deeply researched book investigates the changing personal, social, and cultural world of the eighteenth century. His startling conclusions redefine and illuminate both the experience and the legacy of France&#x2019;s transformative age of revolution.</p><p>In this strikingly new account of the impact of the French Revolution in Paris, across the French countryside, and around the globe, the author draws startling conclusions about life during the years of upheaval and the Revolution&#x2019;s perplexing, fascinating legacy.<br><b>Peter McPhee</b> serves as a professorial fellow at the University of Melbourne, and is an internationally esteemed historian of modern France.

They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, <i>The Time Machine, </i>not its potential for misuse and terror. In <i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i> a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life. <br><br>While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells&#x2019;s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing &#x201c;smarter&#x201d; human beings or bringing back extinct species. These levels of interpretation add a richness to Prendick&#x2019;s adventures on Dr. Moreau&#x2019;s island of lost souls without distracting from what is still a rip-roaring good read.</p><p>A shipwreck in the South Seas, a palm-tree paradise where a mad doctor conducts vile experiments, animals that become human and then "beastly" in ways they never were before--it's the stuff of high adventure. It's also a parable about Darwinian theory, a social satire in the vein of Jonathan Swift (<i>Gulliver's Travels</i>), and a bloody tale of horror. Or, as H. G. Wells himself wrote about this story, "<i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i> is an exercise in youthful blasphemy. Now and then, though I rarely admit it, the universe projects itself towards me in a hideous grimace. It grimaced that time, and I did my best to express my vision of the aimless torture in creation." This colorful tale by the author of <i>The Time Machine</i>, <i>The Invisible Man</i>, and <i>The War of the Worlds</i> lit a firestorm of controversy at the time of its publication in 1896.Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price.

A legendary essayist, political philosopher and member of the French resistance, her literary output belied her tragically short life. Most of her work was published posthumously, to widespread acclaim. Always concerned with the nature of individual freedom, Weil explores in <em>Oppression and Liberty</em> its political and social implications. Analyzing the causes of oppression, its mechanisms and forms, she questions revolutionary responses and presents a prophetic view of a way forward. If, as she noted elsewhere, 'the future is made of the same stuff as the present', then there will always be a need to continue to listen to Simone Weil.</p><p>&#39;Weil&#39;s particular form of independent Marxism combined with a later turn to mysticism and religion provides a provocative tradition.

And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

Charging that most of the environmental movement has ignored or rejected the changes in thinking that have infiltrated ecological theory since the mid 70s, William Drury presents a convincing case that disorder is what makes the natural world work, and that clinging to romantic notions of nature's grand design only saps the strength of the conservation movement. Drury's training in botany, geology, and zoology as well as his life-long devotion to work in the field gave him a depth and range of knowledge that few ecologists possess. This book opens our eyes to a new way of looking at the environment and forces us to think more deeply about nature and our role in it.<br><br><i>Chance and Change</i> is intended for the serious amateur naturalist or professional conservationist. Drury argues that chance and change are the rule, that the future is as unpredictable to other organisms as it is to us, and that natural disturbance is too frequent for equilibrium models to be useful. He stresses the centrality of natural selection in explaining the meaning of biology and insists the book and the laboratory must be checked at all times against the real world. Written in an easy, personal style, Drury's narrative comes alive with the landscape&#x2015;the salt marshes, dunes, seashores, and forests&#x2015;that he believed served as the best classroom. His novel approach of correlating landscape evolution with ecological principles offers a welcome corrective to discordance between what we observe in nature and what theory tells us we <i>should</i> see.</p><p>Most politically active environmentalists, writes the late biologist William Drury, have at least some knowledge of equilibrium theory, "the characteristic ecology taught in introductory textbooks" through which the so-called balance of nature is explained. Believing that this theory, if oversimplified, can lead to doctrinaire reactions (the view, for example, that human economic development is necessarily harmful to the environment), Drury proposes a more complex understanding of nature that takes into account chance and change, and that recognizes that "natural disturbance is too frequent for equilibrium models to be useful." Discussing notions such as microcosm versus macrocosm, the great chain of being, and succession, Drury offers a vigorous textbook that deepens our understanding of how the world works. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>&#34;This is a common-sensical critique of almost all ecological theory. . . . If this were to be carefully read and widely distributed it would be of major importance (if only in arousing the ire of the more pompous conservationist qua shamanist establishment.&#34; (Lawrence B.

Weaving together research, dynamic album covers, session photographs, and nearly one hundred interviews with executives, journalists, producers, and musicians from Ray Charles and Alice Coltrane to Quincy Jones, Pharoah Sanders, McCoy Tyner, and others--this is the riveting tale of an era-shaping jazz label in the age of rock. The thirty-eight Album Profiles--a veritable book within a book--offer a consumer's guide to the best and most timeless titles on Impulse. 120 illustrations</p><p>Ashley Kahn is an award-winning journalist and radio essayist and the author of A Love Supreme: The Story of John Coltrane&#x2019;s Signature Album and A Kind of Blue: The Making of the Miles Davis Masterpiece. He lives in Fort Lee, New Jersey.<i>Starred Review.</i> Noted jazz writer Kahn follows up his in-depth account of the making of jazz legend John Coltrane's most famous album, <i>A Love Supreme</i>, with a history of the record label Coltrane ushered into jazz history. Always a corporate entity (though it changed hands several times between its inception in 1961 and the present), Impulse! was founded by legendary jazz producer Creed Taylor as an imprint of ABC-Paramount records. During Taylor's short stint as label head (before being recruited to overhaul Verve Records), he signed Impulse!'s first exclusive artist, Coltrane, who, through his endless musical questing, recommendations of other artists and status as the label's bestseller, would define Impulse!'s sound and proclivity toward the avant-garde. Taylor's successor, Bob Thiele, was the major driving force at Impulse!, however, supporting Coltrane through his prolific, often confounding musical experiments and producing records by such other influential artists as Archie Shepp, McCoy Tyner and Pharoah Sanders. Kahn mingles engaging stories of corporate politics with insider accounts of music-making and anecdotal takes on particular albums. His history of Impulse! is also the story of the genesis of an American art form and the evolution of the record industry through the tumultuous 1960s&#x2014;and will compel readers to seek out this label's masterful albums.

Through illustrations he shows in detail how they relate to the landscape and its various textures and how their cryptic spring and autumn camouflage is moulted to a thick white coat during the winter months. He witnesses the vagaries of the climate from icy winter scenes to unseasonable June snowfalls which threaten incubating birds and new-born hare leverets. By rearing a brood of captive ptarmigan he has been able to witness at first hand the growth from hatching of downy chicks to full winter plumage. His drawings and paintings for &#34;Mountain Reflections&#34; present an insight into an intriguing life cycle. However, Brockie has not ignored the other aspects of mountain wildlife. The book features detailed studies of the patterns and textures of red deer fawns, aggressive cock-red grouse and delicate dotterel chicks. Necessary predators such as the red fox, golden eagle and peregrine falcon complete the food chain, while the artist draws also on his experiences of expeditions to Greenland to feature the Nearctic counterparts of the hare and ptarmigan as well as musk oxen, Arctic fox and lemmings. Throughout the volume the flora and faunas are reproduced with a sympathy and knowledge born of many hours, days and weeks working in the field.</p><p></p><h2>Year of the Flood</h2><p>Set in the near future, Attwood&#39;s dark, thoughtful and at times funny novel finds two women who have survived a cataclysmic environmental disaster - a young trapeze artist locked in a sex club and a &#39;God&#39;s Gardener&#39; hiding in a luxury spa - and both must find their way out.</p><p><b>Book Description</b><br> The long-awaited new novel from Margaret Atwood. <i>The Year of the Flood</i> is a dystopic masterpiece and a testament to her visionary power. <p>The times and species have been changing at a rapid rate, and the social compact is wearing as thin as environmental stability. Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible.</p> <p>Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers...</p> <p>Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away...</p> <p>By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, <i>The Year of the Flood</i> is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive. </p> <strong>Margaret Atwood on <i>The Year of the Flood</i></strong><br><br> I&#x2019;ve never before gone back to a novel and written another novel related to it. Why this time? Partly because so many people asked me what happened right after the end of the 2003 novel, <i>Oryx and Crake</i>. I didn&#x2019;t actually know, but the questions made me think about it. That was one reason. Another was that the core subject matter has continued to preoccupy me. <p></p> <p>When <i>Oryx and Crake</i> came out, it seemed to many like science fiction--way out there, too weird to be possible--but in the three years that passed before I began writing <i>The Year of the Flood</i>, the perceived gap between that supposedly unreal future and the harsh one we might very well live through was narrowing fast. What is happening to our world? What can we do to reverse the damage? How long have we got? And, most importantly--what kind of "we"? In other words, what kind of people might undertake the challenge? Dedicated ones--they&#x2019;d have to be. And unless you believe our planet is worth saving, why bother? </p> <p>So the question of inspirational belief entered the picture, and once you have a set of beliefs--as distinct from a body of measurable knowledge--you have a religion. The God&#x2019;s Gardeners appear briefly in <i>Oryx and Crake</i>, but in <i>The Year of the Flood</i>, they&#x2019;re central. Like all religions, the Gardeners have their own leader, Adam One. They also have their own honoured saints and martyrs, their special days, their theology. They may look strange and obsessive and even foolish to non-members, but they&#x2019;re serious about what they profess; as are their predecessors, who are with us today. I&#x2019;ve found out a great deal about rooftop gardens and urban beekeeping while writing this book!</p> <p>Another question frequently asked about <i>Oryx and Crake</i> concerned gender. Why was the story told by a man? How would it have been different if the narrator had been a woman? Such questions led me to Ren and Toby, and then to their respective lives, and also to their places of refuge. A high-end sex club and a luxury spa would in fact be quite good locations in which to wait out a pandemic plague: at least you&#x2019;d have bar snacks, and a lot of clean towels.</p> <p>In his book, <i>The Art Instinct</i>, Denis Dutton proposes that our interest in narrative is built in--selected during the very long period the human race spent in the Pleistocene--because any species with the ability to tell stories about both past and future would have an evolutionary edge. Will there be a crocodile in the river tomorrow, as there was last year? If so, better not go there. Speculative fictions about the future, like <i>The Year of the Flood</i>, are narratives of that kind. Where will the crocodiles be? How will we avoid them? What are our chances? <i>--Margaret Atwood</i></p> <p>(Photo � George Whiteside)</p>Margaret Atwood&#x2019;s internationally bestselling fiction includes <b>The Handmaid&#x2019;s Tale</b>, <b>Alias Grace</b>, <b>The Blind Assassin</b>, and<b> Oryx and Crake</b>.

It's a novel concept that early on begins to fade, however, as the by-the-numbers supervillains roll out and the plot fails to create much real drama. While some comics fans may enjoy reading the adventures of B- or C-level characters in the DC Universe, simply having a hero, a villain, and Superman in a few panels is not enough to attract a wide readership. The artwork is glorious, each scene having real comic appeal and an old-fashioned, spirited, aggressive paneling, but the players and the story are flat.&#x2014;<i>John Leighton, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His consensus: America is a nation of Gnostics, believers in a pre-Christian tradition of individual divinity.</p><p>Bloom wanders a bit, away from Yale into ``the Evening Land'' of America and its churches--and reconstructs a remarkable diagram of the religious imagination. As a literary critic, Bloom has shown an increasing fascination of late with scriptural texts and religious imagery (The Book of J, 1990; Ruin the Sacred Truths, 1988). Here, he attempts to go one step further and provide an exegesis of the religions themselves, concentrating on those sects--Mormons, Shakers, Southern Baptists, etc.--whose origins are particularly rooted in American history and American patterns of thought. ``No American,'' according to Bloom, ``feels free if he is not alone, and no American ultimately concedes that he is part of nature.'' The resulting solitude of American life has given rise, as Bloom recounts, to a phenomenal array of ``enthusiastic'' cults, all of which purport to give the individual direct access to divine truth without the mediation of church or priest. Bloom is clearsighted enough to understand the ramifications of this, remarking quite rightly that in religious terms it amounts to a re-making of God in man's image--a process that turns every traditional Christian theology inside out. As a self-styled ``Jewish Gnostic,'' Bloom celebrates this Promethean refashioning, but as a religious critic he is equally sensitive to the contradictions it engenders-- particularly in the case of the Baptist fundamentalists. The political lessons that he extrapolates (mainly on the basis of the theistic rhetoric of the Republican Party) are not so clearly argued, however, and become annoying after a while. A great bolt of originality: Bloom manages to wade into a hopelessly overexplored territory and point out precisely those landmarks that everyone else has missed. Remarkable ideas remarkably set forth. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Without knowing it, American worshipers have moved away from Christianity and now embrace pre-Christian Gnosticism, asserts Bloom ( The Book of J ). In his most controversial book to date, the Yale professor defines "the American Religion" as a Gnostic creed stressing knowledge of an inner self that leads to freedom from nature, time, history and other selves. Every American, he writes, assumes that God loves her or him in a personal, intimate way, and this trait is the bedrock of our national religion, a debased Gnosticism often tinged with selfishness. The core of this odd, ponderous book focuses on Pentecostals, Christian Scientists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-Day Adventists and especially Mormons and Southern Baptists--the two denominations Bloom believes will dominate future American religious life. He argues that mainline Protestants, Jews, Roman Catholics and secularists are also much more Gnostic than they realize. He identifies African-American religion, mystical and emotionally immediate, as a key element in the birth of our home-grown Gnosticism around 1800. Bloom is not likely to win many converts to his viewpoint.

Alison Jackson, author of the Thanksgiving favorite <i>I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Pie</i>, cleverly replaces the heroine of "Clementine" with a dreamy girl named Valentine who keeps missing what's right in front of her nose: the love letters being sent her way by a smitten admirer. Whether carried by pigeon, pony, or freight train, his messages continue to go unnoticed or undelivered. But just when the lovelorn writer loses all hope, something unexpected happens that proves his crush isn't so one-sided after all. Brought to life by the larky illustrations of Tricia Tusa, this silly and sweet tale is perfect for little valentines as well as grown-up sweethearts.</p><p>Alison Jackson is the award-winning artist who created the BBC TV series <b>Double Take </b>and the internationally acclaimed Schweppes advertising campaign. After studying sculpture and then Fine Art Photography at the Royal College of Art in London, Alison's work, has for the last five years, astonished and sometimes shocked audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.<p> <br><b>Tricia Tusa</b> lives in Houston, Texas.</p>"In a cabin, in a canyon,/ Near a mountain laced with pine,/ Lived a girl who was my sweetheart,/ and her name was Valentine," begins Jackson's (I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Pie) clever adaptation of the familiar folksong "Clementine." Tusa's (Mrs. Spitzer's Garden) sure black line and watercolors add another layer of hilarity to this story-in-song of a resourceful mountain lady and her harried suitor who, through a string of missteps, keep failing to connect. After giving his love letters "to a mailman/ To deliver, rain or shine," Valentine's beau tries more imaginative means, including a homing pigeon that gets sidetracked in Madagascar, and skywriting ("But the wind erased three letters,/ And you're now my -al-n-ine"). Meanwhile, the paintings show the industrious, pointy-nosed object of his affection just missing each message as she tends to frontier chores with a brisk cheeriness. The artist reassuringly establishes from the outset that the feeling is mutual: he keeps a picture of Valentine on his piano; she keeps a cameo of him on her bureau. Attentive readers will detect that the sweethearts' homes are not so far apart, and as the lovestruck fellow misses his target repeatedly, Valentine begins a holiday token of her own affection. It's finally Valentine's personal presentation of her gift that leads to the pair's rendezvous. This inspired treatment of an age-old tale communicates plenty about love.

What he discovers is unimaginable: a deadly vendetta against the Catholic Church by a centuries-old underground organization - the Illuminati. Desperate to save the Vatican from a powerful time bomb, Langdon joins forces in Rome with the beautiful and mysterious scientist Vittoria Vetra. Together they embark on a frantic hunt through sealed crypts, dangerous catacombs, deserted cathedrals, and the most secretive vault on earth . . . the long-forgotten Illuminati lair.</p><p>It takes guts to write a novel that combines an ancient secret brotherhood, the Swiss Conseil Europ�en pour la Recherche Nucl�aire, a papal conclave, mysterious ambigrams, a plot against the Vatican, a mad scientist in a wheelchair, particles of antimatter, jets that can travel 15,000 miles per hour, crafty assassins, a beautiful Italian physicist, and a Harvard professor of religious iconology. It takes talent to make that novel anything but ridiculous. Kudos to Dan Brown (<i>Digital Fortress</i>) for achieving the nearly impossible. Angels &amp; Demons is a no-holds-barred, pull-out-all-the-stops, breathless tangle of a thriller--think Katherine Neville's <i>The Eight</i> (but cleverer) or Umberto Eco's <i>Foucault's Pendulum</i> (but more accessible). <p></p> Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is shocked to find proof that the legendary secret society, the Illuminati--dedicated since the time of Galileo to promoting the interests of science and condemning the blind faith of Catholicism--is alive, well, and murderously active. Brilliant physicist Leonardo Vetra has been murdered, his eyes plucked out, and the society's ancient symbol branded upon his chest. His final discovery, antimatter, the most powerful and dangerous energy source known to man, has disappeared--only to be hidden somewhere beneath Vatican City on the eve of the election of a new pope. Langdon and Vittoria, Vetra's daughter and colleague, embark on a frantic hunt through the streets, churches, and catacombs of Rome, following a 400-year-old trail to the lair of the Illuminati, to prevent the incineration of civilization. <p></p> Brown seems as much juggler as author--there are lots and lots of balls in the air in this novel, yet Brown manages to hurl the reader headlong into an almost surreal suspension of disbelief. While the reader might wish for a little more sardonic humor from Langdon, and a little less bombastic philosophizing on the eternal conflict between religion and science, these are less fatal flaws than niggling annoyances--readers should have no trouble skimming past them and immersing themselves in a heck of a good read. "Brain candy" it may be, but my! It's tasty. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i> <br><br> <p><strong>Look Inside the Motion Picture <i>Angels &amp; Demons</i> (Sony Pictures, 2009) </strong><br> Click on each image below to see a larger view<br><br> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br> Ewan MacGregor as Carlo Ventresca with College of Cardinals</p></td> <td> <p><br> Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon </p></td> </tr></tbody></table><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br> Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon and Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra</p></td> <td> <p><br> Armin Mueller-Stahl as Straus and Ewan MacGregor as Carlo Ventresca </p></td> </tr></tbody></table> <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br> Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra, and Ewan MacGregor as Carlo Ventresca</p></td> <td> <p><br> Ewan MacGregor as Carlo Ventresca </p></td></tr></tbody></table> <p></p>DAN BROWN is the bestselling author of <i>Digital Fortress</i>, <i>Deception Point</i>, and <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>.

But after their final, brutal confrontation with the F'dor, their world crosses the threshold of disaster and faces utter oblivion. The action reaches a fevered pitch, achieving a crescendo of tragedy, love, and triumph of human spirit over world-shattering cataclysm. <br><br>With death at hand and the world crumbling at their feet, these three will finally discover their true Destiny.<br><br></p><p>In a book world awash in sword-slinging fantasy novels, each trying to out-Jordan the other, the arrival of yet another big new series on the scene is... no big deal. But much to the delight of readers bored to tears by doorstopper clones, Elizabeth Haydon's three-part tale is unique, thrilling, and utterly romantic from start to finish. The story of a magical singer of extraordinary power and her battle with a blood-soaked demon began in <i>Rhapsody: Child of Blood</i> and continued in <i>Prophecy: Child of Earth</i>. The trilogy's final volume, <i>Destiny: Child of the Sky</i> offers fantasy fans something they crave, but don't often see--a great ending.<p> When last we saw our lovely heroine Rhapsody and her two best friends Achmed and Grunthor, they had just rescued the Sleeping Child from the evil tendrils of the F'dor. But as they found out through the tragic loss of their young friend Jo, the three must follow the demon's trail of violence and blood, finding the children it has spawned across the land in order to track it down and destroy it once and for all. As in the previous two books, Rhapsody's love of her friends and desire to save children in danger drive her most reckless actions. </p><p> Elizabeth Haydon delivers us from the fantasy traps of never-ending plots, wooden characters, and yawn-inducing battles. She takes much of her style from romance and suspense novels, rather than historical fiction, giving her books real depth of emotion and humanity. It's true that there are spots of sentimentality that may leave some hardened adventure fans groaning, but that very thing may help explain why Haydon's books have succeeded with crossover romance readers so admirably. We can only hope she'll set her sights on another swoony adventure as soon as possible. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p><br>Elizabeth Haydon first began writing in the fourth grade. Writing a play was one option in a history assignment so, along with a couple of friends, she put on a fairly awful play she had written which was called The Clue in the Diary. Writing fiction became a dream at that point. She took courses in college, but didn't believe she would be able to make a living from it. <br>She had read C.S. Lewis as a young child, J.R.R. Tolkien as an older one, and some fantasy in college, but had lost touch with the field after that. She was working in educational publishing in 1994 when she met up with an editorial friend and mentor in New Orleans at the American Library Association conference. He asked her to write for him a fantasy that might cross over to other genres and contain some of their shared mutual interests: medieval music, history, anthropology, and herbalism among others. Since they had been drinking Dixie Blackened Voodoos, she was initially hesitant to take on the project, worried that he might have been a bit tipsy when he suggested it. But when it became clear he really wanted her to do it, <i>The Symphony of Ages</i> was born.<br><br>These novels have made numerous "Best of the Year" as well as national bestseller lists. The <i>Romantic Times</i> called it "an epic saga worthy of Eddings, Goodkind &amp; Jordan". A harpist and madrigal singer, Elizabeth Haydon lives on the East Coast with her husband and three children, where she is writing fantasy novels for both <i>The Symphony of Ages</i> for adults and the <i>Adventures of Ven Polypheme</i> for children.<br><br></p><h2>The Gospel of Life (Evangelium Vitae)</h2><p>The Gospel of Life contains the complete text of the Pontiff&#39;s encyclical letter on the sanctity of life in the modern world.

Carse draws upon personal experiences to illustrate his insights, beginning with his observations of the proprietor of the Victory luncheonette in the East Village. A vet who lost a leg in combat, Ernie serves his customers with fluid energy and grace, working and cajoling his way through life with a minimum of resistance or resentment. As Carse recalls his own Wisconsin youth, including an unforgettable description of sailing Lake Michigan by starlight, he ponders the speechlessness of animals and the verbosity of humans, the roles of teacher and student, and the fact that there is no end to knowing. As he remembers the deadhis wife of 37 years and his brotherCarse muses on how easily we confuse religious practice with God, knowledge with understanding, and our visible, public selves with inner truth. <i>Donna Seaman</i>This thought-provoking book turns ordinary experiences on their heads, almost forcing readers to find the mystical in their own subjective engagement of daily events. Carse ( Finite and Infinite Games ), who is director of Religious Studies and professor of the history of literature at NYU, interprets his own life with the help of the Sufi poets, Aristotle, Descartes and Freud. Drawing parables from daily experience (a golf match, a Halloween party, a mouse eating a grain), Carse gently prods us to see beyond the obvious in the world and in our lives. In so doing, he brings the profound within the grasp of everyone. The engaging and insightful stories reconsidered here also explain why Carse has gained an almost cult-like following on his own campus as well as beyond it. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Oddkins: A Fable for All Ages</h2><p>The Oddkins, secret toys that aid and inspire children facing serious problems or sorrow, battle a band of evil basement toys in their search for a magic-sustaining toymaker</p><p>Dean Koontz is the author of fifty-six New York Times bestsellers, including Odd Thomas, From the Corner of His Eye, and Watchers. His books are published in thirty-six languages and his worldwide sales top 450 million copies. With Oddkins, his first book for young readers, Koontz introduces a magical and dazzling world of toys and terror, good versus evil. Oddkins is a fable for our time, a deeply moving story for all ages.Though it looks and reads like a children's book, the latest work by bestselling novelist Koontz ( Watchers , Lightning ) is being marketed for adult audiences. As such, it falls far short of even adequate: both stylistically and in terms of characterization, it lacks the complexity that would engage an adult reader's interest. The living toys Isaac Bodkins makes in his magic workshop are designed to be sent out into the world to befriend troubled or mistreated children. As the book opens, Bodkins has just died, and the toys must attempt a long trek across town to tell young Colleen Shannon that she is the new magic toymaker. Now that Bodkin's benign spirit has departed, however, the evil toys in the sub-basement are coming to life, and they are intent on destroying their benevolent counterparts and installing their own dark-souled creator to spread sorrow and fear among children. The trip across town becomes a harrowing adventure, providing enough excitement and humor to hold a child's attention but not enough to motivate an adult to appropriate the work for the family bookcase. Parks's illustrations are excellent. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Only Language They Understand: Forcing Compromise in Israel and Palestine</h2><p><p><b>In a myth-busting analysis of the world's most intractable conflict, a star of Middle East reporting, "one of the most important writers" in the field (<i>The New York Times</i>), argues that only one weapon has yielded progress: force.</b></p><p>Scattered over the territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea lie the remnants of failed peace proposals, international summits, secret negotiations, UN resolutions, and state-building efforts. The conventional story is that these well-meaning attempts at peacemaking were repeatedly, perhaps terminally, thwarted by violence.</p><p>Through a rich interweaving of reportage, historical narrative, and powerful analysis, Nathan Thrall presents a startling counter-history. He shows that force&#x2015;including but not limited to violence&#x2015;has impelled each side to make its largest concessions, from Palestinian acceptance of a two-state solution to Israeli territorial withdrawals. This simple fact has been neglected by the world powers, which have expended countless resources on initiatives meant to diminish friction between the parties. By quashing any hint of confrontation, promising an imminent negotiated solution, facilitating security cooperation, developing the institutions of a still unborn Palestinian state, and providing bounteous economic and military assistance, the United States and Europe have merely entrenched the conflict by lessening the incentives to end it. Thrall&#x2019;s important book upends the beliefs steering these failed policies, revealing how the aversion of pain, not the promise of peace, has driven compromise for Israelis and Palestinians alike. </p><p>Published as Israel's occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza reaches its fiftieth anniversary, which is also the centenary of the Balfour Declaration that first promised a Jewish national home in Palestine, <i>The Only Language They Understand</i> advances a bold thesis that shatters ingrained positions of both left and right and provides a new and eye-opening understanding of this most vexed of lands.</p></p><p><b>Nathan Thrall</b> is a leading analyst of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He is a regular contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books</i> and the <i>London Review of Books</i> and is a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, for which he has covered Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza since 2010. His writing and analysis are often featured in print and broadcast media, including <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Bloomberg News, the <i>Financial Times</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The Economist</i>, <i>Time</i>, CNN, <i>Democracy Now!</i>, PRI, and the BBC. He lives in Jerusalem with his wife and daughters.<p>&#x201c;Nathan Thrall does a brilliant job describing the political and geostrategic reasons for the intractability... His argument is smart and hard to dispute.&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2015;The New York Times Book Review</b></i><br><i><b></b></i><br>&#x201c;This June, Israel is marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Six-Day War. Not surprisingly, a number of new books have appeared in this grim anniversary year.... By far the most cogent... is Nathan Thrall&#x2019;s <i>The Only Language They Understand</i>, which surveys the last five decades and comes to a remarkable conclusion: the only way to produce some kind of movement toward resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is to apply significant coercive force to the parties involved, and in particular to Israel.&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2015;The New York Review of Books</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;Thrall has consistently been one of the sharpest observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the United States&#x2019; role in trying to end it, and his most recent contribution, <i>The Only Language They Understand</i>, is true to form.... His argument is a compelling one, and Thrall expertly marshals historical evidence to demonstrate his thesis that both sides respond to sticks rather than carrots.&#x201d; <br><i><b>&#x2015;Foreign Affairs</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;Thrall is one of the best-informed and most trenchant observers of the conflict.&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2015;Financial Times</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;Life is short, and writings about Israel and the Palestinians can be very, very long.

Just about everyone interested in peace between Israelis and Palestinians will learn something and find something to ponder.&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2015;Jerusalem Post</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;Nathan Thrall, an analyst with the International Crisis Group and consummate observer of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, adds substantially to our understand of the status quo in his perfectly timed new volume.&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2015;Tablet</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;Thrall makes a persuasive case that instead of leaving the Israelis and Palestinians alone or limply warning of the peril facing Israeli democracy if a two-state solution isn't achieved, the only weapon in the US arsenal that has ever produced meaningful gains on the issue is force&#x2015;diplomatic, economic, or otherwise.&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2015;Vice</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;An important new book... eloquently expresses what has long been clear: that there is no hope of a breakthrough unless the international community forces it on the parties.&#x201d;<br><i><b>&#x2015;The Independent (UK)</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;Nathan Thrall&#x2019;s commentary on the most intractable dispute of our time is something shocking: it is fair. Into a debate consumed by ferocious passions he enters dispassionately, except that he has a passion for peace. For this reason he is uncommonly trustworthy. His familiarity with the infamous complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian tangle is remarkable, as is his mental composure. This learned and candid book is a genuine contribution to our understanding of an increasingly frightening conflict.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Leon Wieseltier</b></p><p>&#x201c;Both the book and the title of <i>The Only Language They Understand</i> perfectly encapsulate the attitudes of the two sides to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The title also illustrates Thrall&#x2019;s main thesis: that over the entire hundred years of this conflict, only force or the threat of force, whether military, political, economic, diplomatic or in another form, has obligated the two sides to compromise. This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand why this conflict is so intractable and remains unresolved.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Rashid Khalidi,</b> author of <i>Brokers of Deceit</i> and Edward Said Professor of Arab Studies, Columbia University</p><p>&#x201c;A terrific piece of analysis by a keen and empathic observer of the region.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Lawrence Wright,</b> author of <i>The Looming Tower </i>and <i>Thirteen Days in September</i></p><p>&#x201c;These are the toughest criticisms anywhere of decades of Israeli policy. The failings of the Palestinians are here as well&#x2015;but the arrows are aimed at Jerusalem.

Bush administration</p><p>&#x201c;For those who look at the Middle East and throw up their hands at a hopeless morass, Nathan Thrall&#x2019;s brilliant book is a compelling corrective. This most well-informed and well-connected of experts gives rigorous attention to the reality lurking behind the myths: that in this seemingly frozen conflict, carefully applied power and assiduous compulsion have often been the midwives of progress. Eloquent, fact-rich, full of vivid characters, and relentlessly contemporary in its narrative, <i>The Only Language They Understand</i> is a withering indictment of conventional wisdom&#x2015;and a necessary, essential book.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Mark Danner,</b> author of <i>Spiral: Trapped in the Forever War</i></p><p>&#x201c;Nathan Thrall argues with great power and lucidity that the only language the two sides to the conflict understand is force. This strong view, strongly held by Thrall, has serious political implications. He may be right, he may be wrong, but he must be read by anyone who hasn&#x2019;t given up the idea and the hope of ending this bloody conflict.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2015;Avishai Margalit,</b> author of <i>On Compromise and Rotten Compromises</i></p></p><h2>Measuring the World</h2><p>At the end of the eighteenth century, two brilliant and eccentric young scientists set out to measure the world. Alexander von Humboldt swashbuckled his way across the globe: navigating ocean and jungle, eating with cannibals, swimming with electric eels, lowering himself into volcanoes and scaling the highest mountain known to man. Carl Friedrich Gauss, on the other hand, stayed at home, using the power of thought to battle his way into exotic mathematical realms and the landmark realization that space is curved. Measuring the World brings these two geniuses to life, capturing their balancing act between loneliness and love, absurdity and greatness, failure and success.</p><p>Daniel Kehlmann was born in 1975 in Munich, the son of a director and an actress. He attended a Jesuit college in Vienna, traveled widely, and has won several awards for previous novels and short stories, most recently the 2005 Candide Award. His works have been translated into more than twenty languages, and <i>Measuring the World</i> became an instant best seller in several European countries. Kehlmann is spending the fall of 2006 as writer-in-residence at New York University&#x2019;s Deutsches Haus. He lives in Vienna.The Journey<br><br> In September 1828, the greatest mathematician in the country left his hometown for the first time in years, to attend the German Scientific Congress in Berlin. Naturally he had no desire to go. He had been declining to accept for months, but Alexander von Humboldt had remained adamant, until in a moment of weakness and the hope that the day would never come, he had said yes.<br><br> So now Professor Gauss was hiding in bed. When Minna told him he must get up, the coach was waiting and it was a long journey, he wrapped his arms around the pillow and tried to make his wife disappear by closing his eyes. When he opened them again and Minna was still there, he told her she was a hindrance, and limited, and the misfortune of his old age. When that didn&#x2019;t work either, he pushed back the coverlet and set his feet on the floor.<br><br> Bad-temperedly, he performed the most minimal ablutions and went downstairs. In the parlor, his son Eugen was waiting with a bag packed. As Gauss caught sight of him, he flew into a rage: he broke a jug that was standing on the windowsill, stamped his foot, and struck out wildly. He wasn&#x2019;t even to be calmed when Eugen to one side of him and Minna to the other laid their hands on his shoulders and swore that he would be well taken care of, he would soon be home again, and everything would be over in no time, just like a bad dream. Only when his ancient mother, disturbed by the noise, emerged from her room to pinch his cheek and ask what had happened to her brave boy did he pull himself together. Without warmth he said goodbye to Minna, and absentmindedly stroked the heads of his daughter and youngest son. Then he allowed himself to be helped into the coach.<br><br> The journey was a torture. He called Eugen a failure, took the knobbed stick away from him, and jabbed it full force at his foot. For a time he stared out of the window, a frown on his face, then asked when his daughter was finally going to get married. Why didn&#x2019;t anyone want her, what was the problem?<br><br> Eugen pushed back his long hair, kneaded his red cap with both hands, and didn&#x2019;t want to answer.<br><br> Out with it, said Gauss.<br><br> To be honest, said Eugen, his sister wasn&#x2019;t exactly pretty.<br><br> Gauss nodded; the answer seemed a plausible one. He said he wanted a book.<br><br> Eugen gave him the one he had just opened: Friedrich Jahn&#x2019;s German Gymnastics. It was one of his favorites.<br><br> Gauss tried to read, but seconds later he was already glancing up to complain about the newfangled leather suspension on the coach; it made you feel even sicker than usual. Soon, he explained, machines would be carrying people from town to town at the speed of a shot. Then you&#x2019;d do the trip from G�ttingen to Berlin in half an hour.<br><br> Eugen shrugged.<br><br> It was both odd and unjust, said Gauss, a real example of the pitiful arbitrariness of existence, that you were born into a particular time and held prisoner there whether you wanted it or not. It gave you an indecent advantage over the past and made you a clown vis-�-vis the future.<br><br> Eugen nodded sleepily.<br><br> Even a mind like his own, said Gauss, would have been incapable of achieving anything in early human history or on the banks of the Orinoco, whereas in another two hundred years each and every idiot would be able to make fun of him and invent the most complete nonsense about his charac- ter. He thought things over, called Eugen a failure again, and turned his attention to the book. As he read, Eugen in his distress turned his face fixedly to the window, to hide his look of mortification and anger.<br><br> German Gymnastics was all about exercise equipment. The author expounded at length on this or that piece of appara- tus which he had invented for swinging oneself up or around on. He called one the pommel horse, another the beam, and another the vaulting horse.<br><br> The man was out of his mind, said Gauss, opened the window, and threw the book out.<br><br> That was his book, cried Eugen.<br><br> Quite so, said Gauss, dropped off to sleep, and didn&#x2019;t stir until they reached the stop at the frontier that evening and the horses were being changed.<br><br> While the old horses were being unhitched and the new ones harnessed up, they ate potato soup in an inn. The only other guest, a thin man with a long beard and hollow cheeks, inspected them furtively from the next table. Everything pertaining to the body, said Gauss, who to his irritation had been dreaming about gym apparatus, was the true source of all humiliation. He had always considered it a sign of God&#x2019;s malicious sense of humor that a spirit such as his should be trapped in a sickly body while a common or garden-variety creature like Eugen was, to all intents and purposes, never ill.<br><br> He had had a severe attack of smallpox when he was a child, said Eugen. He had almost died. You could still see the scars!<br><br> True, said Gauss, he&#x2019;d forgotten. He pointed to the post horses outside the window. It was actually quite funny that the rich needed twice as much time to make a journey as the poor. If you used post horses, you could change them after every section. If you had your own, you had to wait until they were fresh again.<br><br> So what, said Eugen.<br><br> Naturally, said Gauss, if you didn&#x2019;t think that much, this would seem obvious. As would the fact that young men carry sticks, and old men don&#x2019;t.<br><br> Students carry a knobbed stick, said Eugen. It had always been that way and always would be.<br><br> Probably, said Gauss, and smiled.<br><br> They spooned up their soup in silence until the gendarme from the frontier post came in to ask for their passports. Eugen gave him his permit: a certificate from the Court which said that although he was a student he was harmless and was permitted to set foot on Prussian soil if accompanied by his father. The gendarme looked at him suspiciously, inspected the pass, nodded, and turned to Gauss. Gauss had nothing.<br><br> No passport, asked the gendarme, astonished, no piece of paper, no official stamp, nothing?<br><br> He had never needed such a thing, said Gauss. The last time he crossed the border from Hannover had been twenty years ago. There hadn&#x2019;t been any problems then.<br><br> Eugen tried to explain who they were, where they were going, and at whose bidding. The Scientific Congress was taking place under the auspices of the crown. As guest of honor, his father&#x2019;s invitation came, so to speak, directly from the king.<br><br> The gendarme wanted a passport.<br><br> There was no way he could know, said Eugen, but his father was honored in the most distant countries, he was a member of all Academies, had been known since his first youth as the Prince of Mathematics.<br><br> Gauss nodded. People said it was because of him that Napo- leon had decided not to bombard G�ttingen.<br><br> Eugen went white.<br><br> Napoleon, repeated the gendarme.<br><br> Indeed, said Gauss.<br><br> The gendarme demanded his passport again, louder than before.<br><br> Gauss laid his head down on his arms and didn&#x2019;t move. Eugen nudged him but it did no good. He didn&#x2019;t care, said Gauss, he wanted to go home, he didn&#x2019;t give a hoot.<br><br> The gendarme fidgeted uneasily with his cap.<br><br> Then the man from the next table joined in. All this would end! Germany would be free, and good citizens would live unmolested and travel sound in mind and body, and would have no further need of bits of paper.<br><br> The incredulous gendarme asked for his passport.<br><br> That was exactly what he meant, cried the man, and dug around in his pockets. Suddenly, he leapt to his feet, knocking over his chair, and bolted outside. The gendarme gaped at the open door for several seconds before pulling himself together and going in pursuit.<br><br> Gauss slowly raised his head. Eugen suggested that they set off again immediately. Gauss nodded and ate the rest of his soup in silence. The little gendarme&#x2019;s hut was empty, both officers having gone after the man with the beard. Eugen and the coachman together pried the barrier up into the air. Then they drove onto Prussian soil.<br><br> Gauss was in good order now, almost cheerful, and talking about differential geometry. It was almost impossible to imagine where the investigation into curved space would lead next. Eugen should be glad he was so mediocre, sometimes such questions could be terrifying. Then he talked about how bitter his youth had been. His own father had been hard and dismissive, so Eugen should think himself lucky. He had started to count before he could talk. Once his father had made an error when he was counting out his monthly pay, and this had made Gauss start to cry. As soon as his father caught the mistake, he immediately fell quiet again.<br><br> Eugen looked impressed, even though he knew the story wasn&#x2019;t true. His brother Joseph had made it up and spread it around. His father must have heard it recounted so often that he had begun to believe it himself.<br><br> Gauss&#x2019;s conversation turned to chance, the enemy of all knowledge, and the thing he had always wished to overcome. Viewed from up close, one could detect the infinite fineness of the web of causality behind every event. Step back and the larger patterns appeared: Freedom and Chance were a question of distance, a point of view. Did he understand?<br><br> Sort of, said Eugen wearily, looking at his pocket watch. It didn&#x2019;t keep very good time, but he thought it must be between four-fifty and five in the morning.<br><br> But the laws of probability, Gauss went on, pressing both hands against his aching back, weren&#x2019;t conclusive. They were not part of the laws of nature, and there could be exceptions. Take an intellect like his own, for example, or a win at a game of chance, which an...</p><h2>Little Drummer Girl</h2><p>Little Drummer Girl, The by Le Carre, John</p><p><strong>John le Carr&#xfffd;</strong> was born in 1931 and attended the universities of Bern and Oxford.

Unlike his best seller, The Closing of the American Mind ( LJ 5/1/87), this collection returns to the original texts upon which many of his ideas rest: Plato, Shakespeare, Rousseau, and Leo Strauss, among others. A brief piece titled "Western Civ" answers his critics, particularly those on the left who almost universally rejected his earlier book as a wrong-headed prescription for reforming American higher education. The essays in this anthology are demanding and probably not the stuff that make a best seller. Nevertheless, the pieces are engaging efforts to address serious ideas Bloom believes have been distorted or turned into dogmas, leaving us too few universal values upon which to build a theory of social justice.

Among the stories are &#39;The Depressed Person&#39;, a dazzling and blackly humorous portrayal of a woman&#39;s mental state; &#39;Adult World&#39;, which reveals a woman&#39;s agonised consideration of her confusing sexual relationship with her husband; and &#39;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&#39;, a dark, hilarious series of portraits of men whose fear of women renders them grotesque. Wallace&#39;s stories present a world where the bizarre and the banal are interwoven and where hideous men appear in many different guises. Thought-provoking and playful, this collection confirms David Foster Wallace as one of the most imaginative young writers around. Wallace delights in leftfield observation, mining the ironic, the surprising and the illuminating from every situation. His new collection will delight his growing number of fans, and provide a perfect introduction for new readers.</p><p>Amid the screams of adulation for bandanna-clad wunderkind David Foster Wallace, you might hear a small peep. It is the cry for some restraint. On occasion the reader is left in the dust wondering where the story went, as the author, literary turbochargers on full-blast, suddenly accelerates into the wild-blue-footnoted yonder in pursuit of some obscure metafictional fancy. <i>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</i>, Wallace's latest collection, is at least in part a response to the distress signal put out by the many readers who <i>want</i> to ride along with him, if he'd only slow down for a second.<p> The intellectual gymnastics and ceaseless rumination endure (if you don't have a tolerance for that kind of thing, your nose doesn't belong in this book), but they are for the most part couched in simpler, less frenzied narratives. The book's four-piece namesake takes the form of interview transcripts, in which the conniving horror that is the male gender is revealed in all of its licentious glory. In the short, two-part "The Devil Is a Busy Man," Wallace strolls through the Hall of Mirrors that is human motivation. (Is it possible to completely rid an act of generosity of any self-serving benefits? And why is it easier to sell a couch for five dollars than it is to give it away for free?) The even shorter glimpse into modern-day social ritual, "A Radically Condensed History of Postindustrial Life," stretches the seams of its total of seven lines with scathing economy: "She laughed extremely hard, hoping to be liked. Then each drove home alone, staring straight ahead, with the very same twist to their faces." Wallace also imbues his extreme observational skills with a haunting poetic sensibility. Witness what he does to a diving board and the two darkened patches at the end of it in "Forever Overhead": </p><blockquote> It's going to send you someplace which its own length keeps you from seeing, which seems wrong to submit to without even thinking.... They are skin abraded from feet by the violence of the disappearance of people with real weight. </blockquote> Of course, not every piece is an absolute winner. "The Depressed Person" slips from purposefully clinical to unintentionally boring. "Tri-Stan: I Sold Sissee Nar to Ecko" reimagines an Arthurian tale in MTV terms and holds your attention for about as long as you'd imagine from such a description. Ultimately, however, even these failed experiments are a testament to Mr. Wallace's endless if unbridled talent. Once he gets the reins completely around that sucker, it's going to be quite a ride. <i>--Bob Michaels</i>David Foster Wallace has made an art of taking readers into places no other writer even gets near. In this exuberantly acclaimed collection he combines hilarity and an escalating disquiet in stories that astonish, entertain, and expand our ideas of the pleasures that fiction can afford.</p><h2>The Finches&#39; Fabulous Furnace</h2><p>When the Finch family moves into the only available house in Ashfield, they find it has a very strange heating system.</p><p></p><h2>The Wisdom of Love: Toward a Shared Inner Life</h2><p>Who can deny that our world is starved for a new understanding of love, of what it means to live together and work at love and not give up?&#x201d; What is the antidote to romantic love that all too often exhausts itself over night?

Designed and stitched by Pennsylvania Amish women between 1870 and 1950, the quilts exemplify the values in a religious culture that, as art critic Hughes notes in the introduction, "puts tremendous premium on stable order and material adequacy." Pieced from unpatterned cloth and arranged in geometric patterns, the quilts are vivid and modern in effect, demonstrating, in Hughes's view, "how absurd the once jealously guarded hierarchical distinctions between 'folk' and 'high' art can be." Silber, curator of the collection, provides brief, informative commentaries. Most eloquent, however, are the quilts themselves. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.The 82 lovely colorplates of outstanding pieces in the Esprit quilt collection in San Francisco, in addition to an enjoyable introductory text by famous art critic Robert Hughes, ensure that this book's reader will appreciate Amish quilts as true works of art.

That would be integrity. But what ranks second? It would have to be persuasiveness. Whether in writing, in person, or on the phone, you are CONSTANTLY making the case for your project or organization. And helping you hone your persuasive skills is at the heart of Tom Ahern&#39;s book. Ask him why he wrote it and he&#39;ll tell you this. Too many fundraisers both verbally and in writing fall flat when asked the question: Why should I support you? They stammer, equivocate, lapse into jargon they do everything but make a convincing case to the would-be donor. If that describes you, then your capital campaign, annual drive, planned giving program, even your website is raising far less than it could if you adopted Tom&#39;s field-tested advice for selling your mission and vision.</p><p>As journalist Gene Fowler put it, "Writing is easy. All you do is stare at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead." <p>Certainly, many of us in fundraising feel that way. </p><p>Whenever we're called upon to draft a solicitation letter, or write copy for the website, or produce a few passages for the annual report, or, heaven forbid, long stretches of a proposal or case statement, we sit there ... and if we're lucky crank out serviceable prose. Few would call it sparkling. </p><p>And too few are moved to write a check in response. </p><p>Each year, bland writing costs organizations mountains of revenue. </p><p>A) There's the expense of producing the materials - the printing, production, and processing, to say nothing of the postage costs. </p><p>B) But much more consequential is the lost revenue - the money not raised when these homogenized materials fail to connect with the very people who would donate if they were motivated by what they read. </p><p>It needn't be this way, and it won't be this way any longer for those who invest a few hours in Tom Ahern's new book, How to Write Fundraising Materials that Raise More Money. </p><p>But here's a twist: Even if you don't write much, you should read this book. Why? Because it's about more than writing - much more. </p><p>In truth, the publisher might have called the book: Getting inside the mind of donors and communicating in a way that inspires their loyalty and generosity. </p><p>What Ahern does �- while showing you how to craft your materials - is to plumb the psychology of donors, uncovering what stimulates interest and instills confidence. His advice applies to all forms communications, written and verbal. </p><p>The short odds are that How to Write Fundraising Materials that Raise More Money will secure a spot in the pantheon of the best fundraising books ever written. Communicating with donors is the bedrock of all fundraising. And no book addresses this topic with such virtuosity.</p>Tom Ahern, author of Raising More Money with Newsletters than You Ever Thought Possible, is recognized as one of North America's top authorities on nonprofit communications. He began presenting his top-rated Love Thy Reader workshops at fundraising conferences in 1999. Since then he has introduced thousands of fundraisers in the U.S., Canada and Europe to the principles of reader psychology, writing, and graphic design that make donor communications highly engaging and successful. <p>He founded his consulting practice in 1990. His firm specializes in capital campaign case statements, nonprofit communications audits, direct mail, and donor newsletters. His efforts have won three prestigious IABC Gold Quill awards, given each year to the best communications work worldwide.

The plot concerns the murder of a young housemaid, discovered naked in a snowy lane, and the cast of suspects spans the social strata. Yet it is William Murdoch, the detective in charge of the case, who breathes life into what might otherwise have been a conventional murder mystery. As he pursues his quest for justice, Murdoch also mourns the death of his fianc�e; his manner of doing both reveals a compassionate, principled man--one whose fictional endeavors (readers hope) have only just begun.In the cold Toronto winter of 1895, the unclad body of a servant girl is found frozen in a deserted laneway. Detective William Murdoch quickly finds out that more than one person connected with the girl?s simple life has something to hide.</p><h2>My Soul&#39;s High Song</h2><p>Gathers poetry and prose by Cullen, Zora Neale Hurston, and Langston Hughes, leading literary figures of the Harlem Renaissance</p><p>For the first time in more than two decades, the very best of Countee Cullen's poetry and prose is available in one collection.<p></p><p>"<i>My Soul's High Song</i> is a generous introduction to new readers of Countee Cullen and a more than generous offering to those of us who hold the poet dear."--Maya Angelou</p>Cullen (1903-46), Harlem Renaissance poet and man of letters, is perhaps best known for the couplet "Yet do I marvel at this curious thing:/ to make a poet black, and bid him sing." His poems infuse a Keatsean prosody with the existential concerns of being black, American, and Christian: "It is a rare and tantalizing fruit/ Our hands reach for, but nothing absolute." Lauded by educated blacks and whites of the Twenties, Cullen's work has been neglected in recent years. This long-overdue collection expands a poetry selection released soon after his death. More poems, a novel, essays, translations, speeches, an interview by James Baldwin, notes, and more have been added by Early, whose fine introduction is a moving portrait of a man whose biography has proven elusive.

You can actually be the most influential person in history!</p><p>As your careful study of the flowchart on the previous pages likely revealed, humans first evolved around the year 200,000 BCE. We call them "anatomically modern humans," and they mark the moment when humans with skeletons exactly the same as ours first appeared. As an experiment, we could put your skeleton beside that of an anatomically modern human from 200,000 years ago and it would be impossible to tell them apart.</p><p>We will not be performing this experiment, but we could.</p><p>But what's fascinating is despite the fact that modern human bodies were now available, nothing really changed. For more than 150,000 years, these humans behaved pretty much the same as any other protohuman species. And then, around the year 50,000 BCE, something happened: these anatomically modern humans suddenly started acting like us. They began to fish, create art, bury their dead, and decorate their bodies. They began to think abstractly.</p><p>Most important, they began to talk.</p><p>The technology of language&#x2014;and it is a technology, it's something we've had to invent, and it took us over 100,000 years to do it&#x2014;is the greatest gift we humans have ever given ourselves. You can still think without language&#x2014;close your eyes and imagine a really cool hat and you've just done it&#x2014;but it limits the kinds of thoughts you can have. Cool hats are easy to imagine, but the meaning of the sentence "Three weeks from tomorrow, have your oldest stepsister meet me on the southeast corner two blocks east from the first house we egged last Halloween" is extremely difficult to nail down without having concrete words for the concepts of time, place, numbers, relationships, and spooky holidays. And if you're struggling to express complex thoughts even in your own head, it's pretty evident that you won't be having those complex thoughts as often, or at all.</p><p>It was language that gave us the ability to imagine better, grander, more world-changing ideas than we otherwise could, and most important, it gave us the ability to store an idea not just in our own heads but inside the minds of others. With language, information can spread at the speed of sound, or, if you're using sign language instead of speaking, at the speed of light. Shared ideas lead to communities, which are the basis of culture and civilization, and which brings us to our first Civilization Pro Tip:&nbsp;<br><i><br>CIVILIZATION PRO TIP: Language is the technology from which all others spread, and you've already got it for free.</i></p><p>This huge expanse of time&#x2014;the 150,000 years between 200,000 BCE, when humans first appeared, to 50,000 BCE, when they finally started talking&#x2014;is where you can have the single greatest effect on history. If you can help humans of this era become behaviorally modern as soon as they became anatomically modern&#x2014;if you can teach them to talk&#x2014;then you can give every civilization on the planet a 150,000-year head start.</p><p>It's probably worth the effort.</p><p>We once thought the change from anatomical to behavioral modernity was due to some physical change in our brains. Perhaps a random genetic mutation in one human&#x2014;who suddenly found themselves able to communicate in ways no animal had done before&#x2014;provided us with the huge advantage of a new capacity for abstract thought? However, the historical record doesn't support the idea of this great leap forward. The things we most associate with behavioral modernity-art, music, clever tools, burying the dead, making ourselves look cooler with jewelry and body paint-all appear before the breakthrough around 50,000 BCE, but in fits and starts, appearing locally and then disappearing. Much like the magic that rhetorical wizards have long revealed was actually inside us all along, so too have humans had the capacity for language. We just needed to unlock it.</p><p>The unique challenge facing you in this era is how to teach a language to people when the very idea of spoken language may be new to them. It's important to remember that most humans you encounter may not have language, but they'll still communicate with one another, through grunts and body language. All you need to do is move them from grunts to words, and don't worry: a complicated language like English with things like "subjunctive clauses" and "imperfect futures" (used here in the grammatical sense, not the time-travel sense) is not necessary, and you can get by with a simplified version of the language you already know, called "pidgin." You will also have better results if you focus on teaching children. The older humans are, the harder it is for them to learn languages, and fluent acquisition of a first language becomes much more challenging-if not impossible-after puberty.</p><p><i>CIVILIZATION PRO TIP</i>:<i> Babies begin to focus on the noises used in language around them after about six months of age, so if you're inventing a language from scratch, you'll likely have more success incorporating whatever sounds the baby is already hearing from its parents.</i></p><p>Remember: evolution happens very slowly, and even 200,000 years ago the people you'll encounter are humans, just like you-indistinguishable at the biological level. They just need to be taught.</p><p>You can teach them.</p><p>And you will be remembered as a god.<br><br></p></p><h2>Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity</h2><p>An unprecedented examination of the ways in which the uninhibited urban sexuality, sexual experimentation, and medical advances of pre-Weimar Berlin created and molded our modern understanding of sexual orientation and gay identity.<br><br>Known already in the 1850s for the friendly company of its &#x201c;warm brothers&#x201d; (German slang for men who love other men), Berlin, before the turn of the twentieth century, became a place where scholars, activists, and medical professionals could explore and begin to educate both themselves and Europe about new and emerging sexual identities. From Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, a German activist described by some as the first openly gay man, to the world of Berlin&#x2019;s vast homosexual subcultures, to a major sex scandal that enraptured the daily newspapers and shook the court of Emperor William II&#x2014;and on through some of the very first sex reassignment surgeries&#x2014;Robert Beachy<i> </i>uncovers the long-forgotten events and characters that continue to shape and influence the way we think of sexuality today. <br><br>Chapter by chapter Beachy&#x2019;s scholarship illuminates forgotten firsts, including the life and work of Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, first to claim (in 1896) that same-sex desire is an immutable, biologically determined characteristic, and founder of the Institute for Sexual Science.

Since the beginning of the week, the Association of German Jurists had been assembling in this magnificent neoclassical structure to present papers and discuss the legal issues of the day. The professional group included lawyers, officials, bureaucrats, and legal academics from the thirty-�nine states and cities of the former German Confederation, a loose association created at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. This imposing body of Ulrichs&#x2019;s colleagues made up the government establishment of the nascent German Empire. Dressed formally even in the midst of summer, they had first met in 1860 to facilitate great tasks of statecraft. As ardent nationalists, they hoped to promote German legal unification, even before the emergence of a nation-�state. Although the jurists&#x2019; political program would have important consequences for the incipient German state, Ulrichs&#x2019;s appearance at the Odeon marked a revolution all its own. He was preparing to address his professional colleagues on an unmentionable subject, same-�sex love, and to protest the various German anti-�sodomy laws that criminalized it.<br><br>Ulrichs had celebrated his birthday the day before, and now, at the age of forty-�two, he hoped to deliver a speech for which he arguably had spent most of his adulthood preparing. As a university student, he had recognized that he was attracted to other men. This sexual peculiarity and rumors of his intimate affairs had forced him to resign the only professional position he had ever held, as a government official. Finally, in an act of enormous courage, he disclosed his secret to his closest kin. Raised in a pious Christian family whose extended members included numerous Lutheran clergy, Ulrichs struggled for years with heart and intellect to make sense of his seemingly unacceptable feelings. Were they unnatural? Had he somehow caused them himself, through actions of his own? He examined carefully his own motivations and desires; he scoured legal and scientific publications on the topic. Following the tradition of the great Protestant reformer Martin Luther, Ulrichs countered prevailing beliefs and developed a theory of his own selfhood&#x2014;�though defined in sexual, not spiritual, terms&#x2014;�forming the conviction that he must face down an established authority and counter centuries of prejudice. To that end, since 1864, Ulrichs had published pamphlets under a pseudonym, arguing his case that sexual deviance was an endowment of nature and must be respected.<br><br>But on that morning in August, crossing Munich&#x2019;s imposing Odeonsplatz, framed by government and cultural buildings, past the grand loggia of the Field Marshals&#x2019; Hall and the baroque spires and dome of the Theatine Church, Ulrichs felt his heart palpitate almost audibly as he neared the Odeon hall. As he would later recount, an inner voice whispered, &#x201c;There is still time to keep silent. Simply waive your request to speak, and then your heart can stop pounding.&#x201d; But Ulrichs also remembered those &#x201c;comrades&#x201d; who were anticipating his protest&#x2014;�&#x201c;Was I to answer their trust in me with cowardice?&#x201d;&#x2014;�and he recalled a desperate acquaintance who had committed suicide to escape criminal pros�ecution for sodomy and the public humiliation that would have followed. &#x201c;With breast beating,&#x201d; Ulrichs entered the building, mounted the speaker&#x2019;s platform, and began reading his text to more than five hundred professional colleagues. &#x201c;Gentlemen,&#x201d; he intoned, &#x201c;my proposal is directed toward a revision of the current penal law&#x201d; to abolish the persecution of an innocent class of persons. &#x201c;It is at the same time,&#x201d; Ulrichs continued, &#x201c;a question of damming a continuing flood of suicides.&#x201d; The victims, he said, were those sexually drawn to members of their own sex.<br><br>Expressions of outrage and scattered cries of &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d; began echoing through the chamber. Alarmed by the voluble hostility, Ulrichs offered to surrender the floor, but others in the audience urged him to continue, and he again took heart. This &#x201c;class of persons,&#x201d; he went on to say, suffered legal persecution only because &#x201c;nature has planted in them a sexual nature that is opposite of that which is usual.&#x201d; Raucous shouts now emanated from the audience; Ulrichs heard hooting, catcalls, and cries of &#x201c;Crucify!&#x201d; from groups on his left and directly in front. On his right stood those who were not prepared for the content of his address and out of curiosity demanded that he finish. But the cacophony overwhelmed Ulrichs and forced him to descend from the podium without finishing his speech, while the assembly chairman attempted to reestablish order. The Association of Jurists refused to press Ulrichs&#x2019;s agenda after the meeting concluded. Within five years member states of the new German Empire had adopted a full penal code in which the punitive Prussian law making a crime of sodomy prevailed over the far more liberal statutes of the other German states. But standing at the podium in Munich, Ulrichs had started something important with the first public coming-�out in modern history.<br><br>Just how much courage did this take? By August 1867 Ulrichs had already forfeited his career and exposed himself to potential rejection by family members. He had little left to lose and later described his appearance before the jurists at the Odeon as the proudest moment of his life. Freed now to go on making a public case for his cause, he continued publishing pamphlets after 1867, but under his own name, not a pseu�donym. And although he failed to avert the imposition of an anti-�sodomy law throughout the newly unified German nation after 1871, his writings and actions helped inspire the world&#x2019;s first movement for homosexual rights, launched a generation later in Berlin, in 1897.<br><br>The truly remarkable aspect of Ulrichs&#x2019;s brave initiative was the important contribution he made to the redefinition&#x2014;�indeed the invention&#x2014;�of sexuality (and homosexuality) in nineteenth-�century Europe. Traditional medical &#x201c;science&#x201d; explained &#x201c;sodomy&#x201d; as a willful perversion and the product of masturbation or sexual excess. &#x201c;Sodomites&#x201d; were understood to be oversexed predators who had simply grown bored with women. The established science of sexual &#x201c;perversion&#x201d; viewed same-�sex erotic activity as that which it seemed to be and nothing more, an isolated genital act. It was possible to imagine, in fact, that almost anyone might succumb to the crime of sodomy, either through seduction or by willful decision, but ultimately as a result of moral weakness. Sexual desire was considered a fluid and malleable drive that might easily be warped and perverted. Only in the 1850s did the first medical doctor, a German in Berlin named Johann Ludwig Casper, question this received wisdom and argue that some &#x201c;sodomites&#x201d; had an innate, biological attraction to the same sex. By 1900 a progressive school of German psychiatry had formed around the belief that same-�sex attraction might be congenital, and somehow an integral feature of a small sexual minority. It became possible now to imagine that certain individuals were attracted innately to their own and not the opposite sex. Indeed, German speakers&#x2014;�both self-�identified same-�sex-�loving men and medical doctors&#x2014;�invented a new language of sexual orientation and identity that displaced the older understanding of perversion and moral failure. Invented terms such as Urning (Ulrichs&#x2019;s own coinage) or &#x201c;homosexual&#x201d; first entered the German lexicon and later other European languages as well. Ulrichs&#x2019;s pamphlet propaganda played a critical role in this development: his theories of an inborn Urning sexuality and character coupled with his outspoken activism helped not only to influence the incipient sciences of sexuality but also to mobilize an imagined community of homosexuals. Concretely, Ulrichs spearheaded a conceptual revolution that transformed erotic, same-�sex love from one of deviant acts into a full-�blown sexual orientation with its own distinct quality and character.<br><br>Ulrichs was an improbable innovator, and certainly an unlikely activist for the civil rights of a sexual minority. Born in 1825 in Aurich, a typical small-�town German community located in East Friesland, which became part of the kingdom of Hanover in 1815, the young Ulrichs was sheltered from the cultural and intellectual life of nineteenth-�century Europe. His father was a district engineering official and civil servant, and his mother&#x2019;s clan included numerous Lutheran pastors. From infancy, Ulrichs&#x2019;s conservative family trained him for academic study and a professional career, either as a bureaucrat or a clergyman. This early preparation endowed him with a restless intelligence, however, and the independence to follow his own calling.<br><br>Ulrichs&#x2019;s family must be seen as elite&#x2014;�despite its small-�town ori- gins&#x2014;�and typical of a wider German class of educated professionals, Bildungsb�rgertum, a group that enjoyed significant social prominence throughout the German territories. What anchored their elite status was education: most attended Gymnasium, the Latin high school that prepared its graduates for university study. Talent was a necessary but rarely sufficient qualification for Gymnasium. Germany&#x2019;s educated elite shared a class background of social and cultural&#x2014;�if not financial&#x2014;�capital, provided by families that could prepare sons for rigorous training and the connections to navigate social and government networks. Higher education was the credential that guaranteed a civil service career as jurist, teacher, cleric, or official in any one of Germany&#x2019;s city, state, or church bureaucracies. Many such families boasted a long string of church or state officials, often stretching back generations. The Ulrichs family was no exception.<br><br>As his parents&#x2019; only surviving son&#x2014;�an older brother died in infancy in 1824&#x2014;�Ulrichs enjoyed the attention and encouragement that prepared him well for academic study. He later described this as a happy childhood: &#x201c;From loving motherly care, I received in part my first education and in part a whole series of other intellectual impressions and influences.&#x201d; Ulrichs&#x2019;s mother also imparted the conservative piety of traditional Lutheranism, teaching her son devotional exercises, scripture, and prayers. After the death of his father in 1835, Ulrichs and his family moved to live near his maternal grandfather and a married sister in the Hanoverian town of Burgdorf, where he was confirmed in the Lutheran Church by his grandfather on Easter Sunday in 1839, a religious and social milestone marking a new stage of his life. Young Karl then attended Gymnasium, first in Detmold, home of his mother&#x2019;s brother (likewise a Lutheran pastor), and then in nearby Celle. The close structure of Ulrichs&#x2019;s family&#x2014;�infused with conservative Protestant religiosity, loving attention, and careful social control&#x2014;�served the boy well. At nineteen he completed his Gymnasium exams with excellent results in Latin and Greek, the subjects required for university entrance.<br><br>That fall, he began legal studies at the University of G�ttingen. Founded in 1734 by George II, ruler of Hanover and also king of Great Britain, G�ttingen was just one of the twenty-�odd German institutions of higher learning established before 1800. Unlike the centralized states of England and France, which had no more than a handful of universities at this time, the semi-�sovereign states of the Holy Roman Empire maintained their independence, both culturally and&#x2014;�to some extent&#x2014;�politically. The size and character of these territories varied tremendously, and counting the tiny estates of the imperial knights numbered above eighteen hundred. The largest, including Brandenburg-�Prussia, Austria, Bavaria, Saxony, and W�rttemberg, often had the trappings of sovereign states. Since the High Middle Ages, the rulers of these largest German territories founded universities in their competition for cultural distinction and to train those who served in state and city bureaucracies. This political fragmentation also explains best the tradition of a Bildungsb�rgertum in German central Europe: the many small and medium-�sized states, each with its own princely court and administrative bureaucracy, required both literate staff and the institutions to educate them. Ulrichs was fortunate to live in the Hanoverian kingdom, since G�ttingen had established itself very quickly as one of the premier German universities. The law faculty was particularly prominent and trained numerous statesman and scholars, including Austrian prime minister Clemens von Metternich; Wilhelm von Humboldt, who founded the University of Berlin in 1810; and Otto von Bismarck, first chancellor of the German Empire when it was formed in 1871. By the first decades of the twentieth century, more than twenty-�five Nobel laureates had G�ttingen affiliations, either as onetime students or professors.<br><br>It was as a student at G�ttingen that Ulrichs first identified the issues that would inspire him to take up his activism. He identified his own sexual peculiarity, and also embraced the ideal of gro�deutsch, or greater German, statehood, a nationalist ideology that promoted the idea of a unified German state that would incorporate all German speakers, including denizens of Austria and the Habsburg crownlands. Although these two strands of political action were seemingly unconnected, Ulrichs&#x2019;s human rights activism and his nationalism were curiously intertwined. By promoting &#x201c;greater German&#x201d; statehood, Ulrichs hoped to counter the influence of Prussia, and, in turn, the likelihood that Prussia&#x2019;s anti-�sodomy statute might be imposed on the other German territories.<br><br>After five semesters in G�ttingen, Ulrichs transferred to the University of Berlin, where he studied for one year. His decision to move was on its face of no particular note; many German students attended several universities before taking a degree. Ulrichs had a special motive, however, for coming to Berlin. In his second year at G�ttingen, he had become self-�consciously aware of his attraction to men. As he divulged later in a family letter, &#x201c;Approximately half a year . . . before I went to Berlin, I was at a dance. . . . But among the dancers there were about twelve young, well-�developed and handsomely uniformed forestry pupils. Although at earlier dances no one caught my attention, I felt such a strong attraction that I was amazed. . . . I would have flung myself at them. When I retired after the ball, I suffered true anxieties in my bedroom, alone and unseen, solely preoccupied by memories of those handsome young men.&#x201d; Clearly this sexual awakening jolted the young Ulrichs, but it also underscored the loneliness he felt in G�ttingen. As far as he could see, there was no one else there like himself.<br><br>Ulrichs almost certainly had an awareness of Berlin&#x2019;s reputation. With a population of nearly 400,000, the city was bound to be more exciting than the sedate university town of G�ttingen. But there was something more specific. As a garrison city, Berlin had been known for its male prostitution since at least the eighteenth century.

Recorded along wth plagues, earthquakes and other natural disasters, is the often destructive impact of public policies Sicily experienced under a succession of conquerorsGreek, Roman, Arab, Norman and Spanish, among themuntil the island's unification with Italy and its participation in 20th century world conflicts. Although in postWW II years Sicily was granted greater autonomy and the 2000-year political hold of big landowners was broken, improvements in agriculture and industry have been thwarted largely, the authors surmise, because of a political-patronage system and a resurgence of the Mafia, which the judiciary has been unable to uproot.

I thought that was in very bad taste. She had her scrapbook laid out on my mahogany coffee table, newspaper clippings neatly arranged in chronological order, the bald statements of death recording all of her Feedings. Nina Drayton&#x2019;s smile was as radiant as ever, but her pale blue eyes showed no hint of warmth.</p> <p>&#x201c;We should wait for Willi,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course, Melanie. You&#x2019;re right, as always. How silly of me. I know the rules.&#x201d; Nina stood and began walking around the room, idly touching the furnishings or exclaiming softly over a ceramic statuette or piece of needlepoint. This part of the house had once been the conservatory, but now I used it as my sewing room. Green plants still caught the morning light. The sunlight made it a warm, cozy place in the daytime, but now that winter had come the room was too chilly to use at night. Nor did I like the sense of darkness closing in against all those panes of glass.</p> <p>&#x201c;I love this house,&#x201d; said Nina. She turned and smiled at me. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you how much I look forward to coming back to Charleston. We should hold all of our reunions here.&#x201d;</p> <p>I knew how much Nina loathed this city, this house.</p> <p>&#x201c;Willi would be hurt,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know how he likes to show off his place in Beverly Hills. And his new girlfriends.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And boyfriends,&#x201d; said Nina and laughed. Of all the changes and darkenings in Nina, her laugh has been least affected. It was still the husky but childish laugh that I had first heard so long ago. It had drawn me to her then&#x2014;one lonely, adolescent girl responding to the warmth of another like a moth to a flame. Now it only served to chill me and put me even more on my guard. Enough moths had been drawn to Nina&#x2019;s flame over the many decades.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send for tea,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>Mr. Thorne brought the tea in my best Wedgwood china. Nina and I sat in the slowly moving squares of sunlight and spoke softly of nothing important; mutually ignorant comments on the economy, references to books which the other had not got around to reading, and sympathetic murmurs about the low class of persons one meets while flying these days. Someone peering in from the garden might have thought they were seeing an aging but attractive niece visiting her favorite aunt. (I draw the line at suggesting that anyone would mistake us for mother and daughter.) People usually consider me a well-dressed if not stylish person. Heaven knows I have paid enough to have the wool skirts and silk blouses mailed from Scotland and France. But next to Nina I always felt dowdy. This day she wore an elegant, light blue dress which must have cost several thousand dollars if I had identified the designer correctly. The color made her complexion seem even more perfect than usual and brought out the blue of her eyes. Her hair had gone as gray as mine, but somehow she managed to get away with wearing it long and tied back with a single barrette. It looked youthful and chic on Nina and made me feel that my short, artificial curls were glowing with a blue rinse.</p> <p>Few would suspect that I was four years younger than Nina. Time had been kind to her. And she had Fed more often.</p> <p>She set down her cup and saucer and moved aimlessly around the room again. It was not like Nina to show such signs of nervousness. She stopped in front of the glass display case. Her gaze passed over the Hummels, the pewter pieces, and then stopped in surprise.</p> <p>&#x201c;Good heavens, Melanie. A pistol! What an odd place to put an old pistol.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s an heirloom,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Quite expensive. And you&#x2019;re right, it is a silly place to keep it. But it&#x2019;s the only case I have in the house with a lock on it and Mrs. Hodges often brings her grandchildren when she visits&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You mean it&#x2019;s loaded?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, of course not,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;But children should not play with such things&#x2026;&#x201d; I trailed off lamely. Nina nodded but did not bother to conceal the condescension in her smile. She went to look out the south window into the garden.</p> <p>Damn her. It said volumes about Nina Drayton that she did not recognize that pistol.</p> <p>On the day he was killed, Charles Edgar Larchmont had been my beau for precisely five months and two days. There had been no formal announcement, but we were to be married. Those five months had been a microcosm of the era itself&#x2014;naive, flirtatious, formal to the point of preciosity, and romantic. Most of all romantic. Romantic in the worst sense of the word; dedicated to saccharine or insipid ideals that only an adolescent&#x2014;or an adolescent society&#x2014;would strive to maintain. We were children playing with loaded weapons.</p> <p>Nina, she was Nina Hawkins then, had her own beau&#x2014;a tall, awkward, but well-meaning Englishman named Roger Harrison. Mr. Harrison had met Nina in London a year earlier during the first stages of the Hawkins&#x2019;s Grand Tour. Declaring himself smitten&#x2014;another absurdity of those childish times&#x2014;the tall Englishman had followed her from one European capital to another until, after being firmly reprimanded by Nina&#x2019;s father (an unimaginative little milliner who was constantly on the defensive about his doubtful social status), Harrison returned to London to &#x201c;settle his affairs&#x201d; only to show up some months later in New York just as Nina was being packed off to her aunt&#x2019;s home in Charleston in order to terminate yet another flirtation. Still undaunted, the clumsy Englishman followed her south, ever mindful of the protocols and restrictions of the day.</p> <p>We were a gay group. The day after I met Nina at Cousin Celia&#x2019;s June Ball, the four of us were taking a hired boat up the Cooper River for a picnic on Daniel Island. Roger Harrison, serious and solemn on every topic, was a perfect foil for Charles&#x2019;s irreverent sense of humor. Nor did Roger seem to mind the good-natured jesting since he was soon joining in the laughter with his peculiar haw-haw-haw.</p> <p>Nina loved it all. Both gentlemen showered attention on her and while Charles never failed to show the primacy of his affection for me, it was understood by all that Nina Hawkins was one of those young women who invariably becomes the center of male gallantry and attention in any gathering. Nor were the social strata of Charleston blind to the combined charm of our foursome. For two months of that now distant summer, no party was complete, no excursion adequately planned, and no occasion considered a success unless we four merry pranksters were invited and had chosen to attend. Our happy dominance of the youthful social scene was so pronounced that Cousins Celia and Loraine wheedled their parents into leaving two weeks early for their annual August sojourns in Maine.</p> <p>I am not sure when Nina and I came up with the idea of the duel. Perhaps it was during one of the long, hot nights when the other &#x201c;slept over&#x201d;&#x2014;creeping into the other&#x2019;s bed, whispering and giggling, stifling our laughter when the rustling of starched uniforms betrayed the presence of our colored maids moving through the darkened halls. In any case, the idea was the natural outgrowth of the romantic pretensions of the time. The picture of Charles and Roger actually dueling over some abstract point of honor related to us thrilled both of us in a physical way which I recognize now as a simple form of sexual titillation.</p> <p>It would have been harmless except for our Ability. We had been so successful in our manipulation of male behavior&#x2014;a manipulation which was both expected and encouraged in those days&#x2014;that neither of us had yet suspected that there lay anything beyond the ordinary in the way we could translate our whims into other people&#x2019;s actions. The field of parapsychology did not exist then: or rather, it existed only in the rappings and knockings of parlor game s�ances. At any rate, we amused ourselves with whispered fantasies for several weeks and then one of us&#x2014;or perhaps both of us&#x2014;used the Ability to translate the fantasy into reality.</p> <p>In a sense it was our first Feeding.</p> <p>I do not remember the purported cause of the quarrel, perhaps some deliberate misinterpretation of one of Charles&#x2019;s jokes. I can not recall who Charles and Roger arranged to have serve as seconds on that illegal outing. I do remember the hurt and confused expression on Roger Harrison&#x2019;s face during those few days. It was a caricature of ponderous dullness, the confusion of a man who finds himself in a situation not of his making and from which he cannot escape. I remember Charles and his mercurial swings of mood&#x2014;the bouts of humor, periods of black anger, and the tears and kisses the night before the duel.</p> <p>I remember with great clarity the beauty of that morning. Mists were floating up from the river and diffusing the rays of the rising sun as we rode out to the dueling field. I remember Nina reaching over and squeezing my hand with an impetuous excitement that was communicated through my body like an electric shock.</p> <p>Much of the rest of that morning is missing. Perhaps in the intensity of that first, subconscious Feeding I literally lost consciousness as I was engulfed in the waves of fear, excitement, pride&#x2026;of maleness&#x2026;that was emanating from our two beaus as they faced death on that lovely morning. I remember experiencing the shock of realizing this is really happening as I shared the tread of high boots through the grass. Someone was calling off the paces. I dimly recall the weight of the pistol in my hand&#x2026;Charles&#x2019;s hand I think, I will never know for sure&#x2026;and a second of cold clarity before an explosion broke the connection and the acrid smell of gunpowder brought me back to myself.</p> <p>It was Charles who died. I have never been able to forget the incredible quantities of blood which poured from the small, round hole in his breast. His white shirt was crimson by the time I reached him. There had been no blood in our fantasies. Nor had there been the sight of Charles with his head lolling, mouth dribbling saliva onto his bloodied chest while his eyes rolled back to show the whites like two eggs embedded in his skull. Roger Harrison was sobbing as Charles breathed his final, shuddering gasps on that field of innocence.</p> <p>I remember nothing at all about the confused hours which followed. It was the next morning that I opened my cloth bag to find Charles&#x2019;s pistol lying with my things. Why would I have kept that revolver? If I had wished to take something from my fallen lover as a sign of remembrance, why that alien piece of metal? Why pry from his dead fingers the symbol of our thoughtless sin?</p> <p>It said volumes about Nina that she did not recognize that pistol.</p> <p>&#x201c;Willi&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was not Mr. Thorne announcing the arrival of our guest but Nina&#x2019;s &#x201c;amanuensis,&#x201d; the loathsome Miss Barrett Kramer. Kramer&#x2019;s appearance was as unisex as her name; short cropped, black hair, powerful shoulders, and a blank, aggressive gaze which I associated with lesbians and criminals. She looked to be in her mid-thirties.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you, Barrett, dear,&#x201d; said Nina.</p> <p>I went to greet Willi, but Mr. Thorne had already let him in and we met in the hallway.</p> <p>&#x201c;Melanie! You look marvelous! You grow younger each time I see you. Nina!&#x201d; The change in Willi&#x2019;s voice was evident. Men continued to be overpowered by their first sight of Nina after an absence. There were hugs and kisses. Willi himself looked more dissolute than ever. His alpaca sports coat was exquisitely tailored, his turtleneck sweater successfully concealed the eroded lines of his wattled neck, but when he swept off his jaunty sportscar cap the long strands of white hair he had brushed forward to hide his encroaching baldness were knocked into disarray. Willi&#x2019;s face was flushed with excitement, but there was also the telltale capillary redness about the nose and cheeks which spoke of too much liquor, too many drugs.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ladies, I think you&#x2019;ve met my associates&#x2026;Tom Reynolds and Jensen Luhar?&#x201d; The two men added to the crowd in my narrow hall. Mr. Reynolds was thin and blond, smiling with perfectly capped teeth. Mr. Luhar was a gigantic Negro, hulking forward with a sullen, bruised look on his coarse face. I was sure that neither Nina nor I had encountered these specific catspaws of Willi&#x2019;s before.</p> <p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we go into the parlor?&#x201d; I suggested. It was an awkward procession ending with the three of us seated on the heavily upholstered chairs surrounding the Georgian tea table which had been my grandmother&#x2019;s. &#x201c;More tea, please, Mr. Thorne.&#x201d; Miss Kramer took that as her cue to leave, but Willi&#x2019;s two pawns stood uncertainly by the door, shifting from foot to foot and glancing at the crystal on display as if their mere proximity could break something. I would not have been surprised if that had proven to be the case.</p> <p>&#x201c;Jensen!&#x201d; Willi snapped his fingers. The Negro hesitated and then brought forward an expensive leather attach� case. Willi set it on the tea table and clicked the catches open with his short, broad fingers. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you two see Miz Fuller&#x2019;s man about getting something to drink?&#x201d;</p> <p>When they were gone Willi shook his head and smiled at Nina. &#x201c;Sorry about that, love.&#x201d;</p> <p>Nina put her hand on Willi&#x2019;s sleeve. She leaned forward with an air of expectancy. &#x201c;Melanie wouldn&#x2019;t let me begin the Game without you. Wasn&#x2019;t that awful of me to want to start without you, Willi dear?&#x201d;</p> <p>Willi frowned. After fifty years he still bridled at being called Willi. In Los Angeles he was Big Bill Borden. When he returned to his native Germany&#x2014;which was not often because of the dangers involved&#x2014;he was once again Wilhelm von Borchert, lord of dark manor, forest, and hunt. But Nina had called him Willi when they had first met in 1925, in Vienna, and Willi he had remained.</p> <p>&#x201c;You begin, Willi,&#x201d; said Nina. &#x201c;You go first.&#x201d;</p> <p>I could remember the time when we would have spent the first few days of our reunion in conversation and catching up with each other&#x2019;s lives. Now there was not even time for small talk.</p> <p>Willi showed his teeth and removed news clippings, notebooks, and a stack of cassettes from his briefcase. No sooner had he covered the small table with his material than Mr. Thorne arrived with the tea and Nina&#x2019;s scrapbook from the sewing room. Willi brusquely cleared a small space.</p> <p>At first glance one might see certain similarities between Willi Borchert and Mr. Thorne. One would be mistaken. Both men tend to the florid, but Willi&#x2019;s complexion was the result of excess and emotion: Mr. Thorne had known neither of these for many years. Willi&#x2019;s balding was a patchy, self-consciously concealed thing&#x2014;a weasel with the mange&#x2014;while Mr. Thorne&#x2019;s bare head was smooth and unwrinkled. One could not imagine Mr. Thorne ever having had hair. Both men had gray eyes&#x2014;what a novelist would call cold, gray eyes&#x2014;but Mr. Thorne&#x2019;s eyes were cold with indifference, cold with a clarity coming from an absolute absence of troublesome emotion or thought. Willi&#x2019;s eyes were the cold of a blustery North Sea winter and were often clouded with shifting curtains of the emotions that controlled him&#x2014;pride, hatred, love of pain, the pleasures of destruction. Willi never referred to his use of the Ability as Feedings&#x2014;I was evidently the only one who thought in those terms&#x2014;but Willi sometimes talked of the Hunt. Perhaps it was the dark forests of his homeland that he thought of as he stalked his human quarry through the sterile streets of Los Angeles. Did Willi dream of the forest? I wondered. Did he look back to green wool hunting jackets, the applause of retainers, the gouts of blood from the dying boar? Or did Willi remember the slam of jackboots on cobblestones and the pounding of his lieutenants&#x2019; fists on doors? Perhaps Willi still associated his Hunt with the dark European ...</p></p><h2>Fleshmarket Close</h2><p>An illegal immigrant is found murdered in an Edinburgh housing scheme: a racist attack, or something else entirely? Rebus is drawn into the case, but has other problems: his old police station has closed for business, and his masters would rather he retire than stick around. But Rebus is that most stubborn of creatures. As Rebus investigates, he must visit an asylum seekers&#39; detention centre, deal with the sleazy Edinburgh underworld, and maybe even fall in love...Siobhan meanwhile has problems of her own. A teenager has disappeared from home and Siobhan is drawn into helping the family, which will mean travelling closer than is healthy towards the web of a convicted rapist. Then there&#39;s the small matter of the two skeletons - a woman and an infant - found buried beneath a concrete cellar floor in Fleshmarket Close. The scene begins to look like an elaborate stunt - but whose, and for what purpose? And how can it tie to the murder on the unforgiving housing-scheme known as Knoxland?</p><p>Born in the Kingdom of Fife in 1960, Ian Rankin graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1982, and then spent three years writing novels when he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish Literature. His first Rebus novel was published in 1987, and the Rebus books are now translated into thirty-six languages and are bestsellers worldwide. Ian Rankin has been elected a Hawthornden Fellow, and is also a past winner of the Chandler-Fulbright Award. He is the recipient of four Crime Writers&#39; Association Dagger Awards including the prestigious Diamond Dagger in 2005. In 2004, Ian won America&#39;s celebrated Edgar Award for Resurrection Men. He has also been shortlisted for the Anthony Award in the USA, won Denmark&#39;s Palle Rosenkrantz Prize, the French Grand Prix du Roman Noir and the Deutscher Krimipreis. Ian Rankin is also the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Edinburgh, Hull and the Open University. A contributor to BBC2&#39;s Newsnight Review, he also presented his own TV series, Ian Rankin&#39;s Evil Thoughts. Rankin is a number one bestseller in the UK and has received the OBE for services to literature, opting to receive the prize in his home city of Edinburgh, where he lives with his partner and two sons.In Rankin's most recent Scottish police procedural, DI John Rebus and DS Siobhan Clark investigate a murder in Edinburgh's Fleshmarket Alley. The story visits the city's seediest, most dangerous places and explores a modern fleshmarket, namely the trafficking of human beings. In spite of the length and expanding plot lines, Michael Page maintains the listener's interest and keeps us informed of the shifting story line. He also excels with voices, offering a range of believable British accents, as well as the accents of assorted immigrants, including Senegalese French. As always, Page delivers a sensitive reading of female voices, which isn't easy for male narrators. A very professional job.

These nations, bound together in the newly formed Littoral Alliance, have begun a covert submarine campaign aimed at crippling China's economy before China can set in motion its own plot to dominate the region.</p><p>In a desperate attempt to buy the president enough time to resolve the crisis diplomatically, Mitchell's submarine squadron is ordered to interfere with attacks by both sides. China and the Littoral Alliance are both determined to win, no matter the cost, and as each side increases the level of violence, they approach a dangerous tipping point. Larry Bond's <i>Shattered Trident</i> is a race against time, as the submarines of Mitchell's squadron must execute their mission before the world witnesses an economic catastrophe&#x2015;or worse, a nuclear exchange.</p></p><p><p>LARRY BOND is the author of numerous <i>New York Times </i>bestselling thrillers, including <i>Exit Plan, Cold Choices, Vortex, Cauldron</i>, and <i>The Enemy Within.</i> He also worked with Jim DeFelice on the Larry Bond's First Team series as well as the Larry Bond's Red Dragon Rising series.

Much of the architecture still reflected French rule, although modern buildings were mixed in everywhere, replacing ones destroyed in &#x201c;The War.&#x201d; <br>The city was filled with history. After his lecture yesterday morning, he&#x2019;d visited the B-52 Victory Museum, escorted by a large party of Vietnamese officers and officials. They&#x2019;d even arranged a meeting with a veteran of the war who&#x2019;d flown MiGs against the Americans. Komamura was still getting used to his celebrity status, but he loved the perks that came with it. <br>His official escort, Commander Nimh, had chatted with the professor in English, since Komamura spoke little Vietnamese. Nimh had read the new Vietnamese translation of Komamura&#x2019;s book, and was obviously enthused to meet its author. Nimh made it clear that he considered the assignment a privilege, and that there had been fierce competition for the spot. <br>They were close to the ministry now. It occupied an entire block of Hanoi, but looked more like a college campus than office buildings or a military headquarters. Light-colored brick buildings with red roofs surrounded a grassy quadrangle with a fountain in the center. Trees dotted the grassy areas and almost surrounded the ministry buildings. <br>They turned out of the morning traffic and stopped at the security gate. In spite of the official car, the driver and Commander Nimh both had to present their identification. The commander showed a letter vouching for Komamura, and the guards checked him against their own access list. <br>There were more security checkpoints after they entered the main building and went to the top floor. As in other military headquarters he&#x2019;d visited, Komamura passed relics in glass cases, paintings of battles, and several images of Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap. At the last checkpoint, he surrendered his smartphone. <br>Komamura was nervous; he&#x2019;d been treated like royalty, and had enjoyed every minute of it. But there comes a time when royalty has to earn its keep. Normally he didn&#x2019;t pay much attention to his appearance, but he&#x2019;d dressed for the occasion in his best suit with a wave-patterned dark blue silk tie embroidered with the kanji character for &#x201c; <i>umi,</i>&#x201d; the sea. <br>Nimh led him to a top-floor conference room. Instead of a large table, there were several groups of comfortable-looking chairs. Occupying three were several older naval officers. Preparing for the trip, Komamura had studied Vietnamese rank insignia. These were senior admirals. <br>A junior officer stepped up to translate, and the professor was quickly introduced to Admiral Hieu, the navy&#x2019;s chief of staff, and Admirals Phai and Duan, the heads of the Vietnamese Navy&#x2019;s political and intelligence directorates. He realized they&#x2019;d all been at his lecture yesterday, but they hadn&#x2019;t been introduced to him at that time. <br>While Nimh served small cups of tea, Komamura took a seat next to the chief of staff. The admiral was old enough to have a puckered scar on his left arm that ran up under his shirtsleeve. Komamura had heard he&#x2019;d been wounded in the south. He hadn&#x2019;t heard how. <br>Komamura was only slightly younger than the admirals, but his expensive suit contrasted sharply with their dark green uniforms. He was also nearly six feet tall, a full head higher than Admiral Hieu and the others. Komamura&#x2019;s large frame filled his chair, and his Buddha-like bulge would never have been tolerated in military service. Their only similarity was a lack of hair. Komamura had a fringe of white, Phai&#x2019;s was thin to the point of transparency, while the other two had simply shaved their scalps. <br>&#x201c;Admiral Kubo sends his best wishes,&#x201d; Komamura said. &#x201c;I spoke with him just before leaving Japan. He remembers your meeting in Honolulu warmly.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;At the Pacific defense chiefs&#x2019; conference,&#x201d; Hieu remembered. &#x201c;Our first discussions there were most helpful.&#x201d; <br>Once Nimh had made sure everyone was settled, he disappeared, leaving Komamura with the three admirals and the translator. The professor knew he faced his examiners. <br>Admiral Phai, the head of the political directorate, began the conversation. &#x201c;The new Vietnamese translation of <i>Navies for Asia</i> has been very well received here. It was even reviewed in <i>Quan Noi Nhan Dan,</i> a mainstream newspaper, although the reviewer criticized it for being &#x2018;pro-Chinese.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>Komamura laughed, almost a chuckle. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what he gets for not reading carefully. Recognizing the growth of Chinese military power doesn&#x2019;t mean I support that growth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We agree with you that the Chinese threat is only going to get worse,&#x201d; Phai responded. &#x201c;Every country bordering the South China Sea has suffered attacks on their exploration ships, unauthorized fishing in their waters, and confrontations with Chinese paramilitary vessels. The number of these incidents is growing, and China makes no apologies.&#x201d; <br>Hieu asked, &#x201c;Have other navies besides Japan and Vietnam shown interest in your book?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lectured in America, and received e-mails from almost every littoral nation. Many are from naval officers. I&#x2019;ve had to hire a secretary. I will be visiting the Republic of Korea almost as soon as my trip here is finished, and a little later, India.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why did you choose naval strategy for your latest work?&#x201d; This came from Admiral Duan, head of the Second General Department, the armed forces&#x2019; intelligence branch. &#x201c;You teach economics at Tokyo University. Your earlier books have been about economics or history.&#x201d; <br>Komamura nodded. &#x201c;True, but it&#x2019;s impossible to separate economics from politics, or politics from war. My latest book began as an analysis of China&#x2019;s rapid economic growth in the new century, but that massive growth demands resources, especially energy and food.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;China has always been hungry, but now her hunger drives her to the sea. I decided to share my conclusions.&#x201d; <br>Duan continued, &#x201c;You are a member of the New Renaissance Party, which promotes a strong military and reverence for the emperor. Isn&#x2019;t your book just a reflection of your political beliefs?&#x201d; <br>The professor shook his head, disagreeing. &#x201c;My political beliefs are rather a reflection of my research.&#x201d; Komamura began ticking off points on his fingers. In Japanese fashion, he raised his little finger first. <br>&#x201c;First, Chinese economic growth requires far more resources than they have. They see those resources close at hand, in the South China Sea. The rapid growth is masking artificialities and serious flaws in the Chinese economy. If their economy slows too much, and it is slowing, it will likely collapse. <br>&#x201c;Second, in pursuit of those resources, China is transforming her navy from a coastal defense force to a blue-water regional power. This is a clear signal of their intentions. <br>&#x201c;Third, U.S. military power in this part of the world is waning. They are still paying the bill for two long wars, and force modernization has suffered. There are also questions about their political will. China is America&#x2019;s second biggest export customer, as well as her greatest importer. Furthermore, China is the largest holder of U.S. debt. I submit that we cannot depend on a distant, weary America to counterbalance nearby Chinese military power.&#x201d; <br>Komamura finished, &#x201c;I joined the New Renaissance Party three years ago, and hope to advise them on economic and security issues.&#x201d; <br>Admiral Hieu had listened as Komamura made his arguments. &#x201c;There are nations that would not be happy to see a stronger Japan, not only free of American support, but unrestrained by any obligations to America.&#x201d; Komamura knew that Vietnam had been occupied by Japan during the Second World War, although they had not suffered as badly as Korea or the Philippines. <br>&#x201c;I do not advocate becoming stronger individually, but rather increasing our strength through alliances independent of U.S. interests, which may not be the same as our own. And what drove Japanese aggression during the Pacific War?&#x201d; Komamura asked pointedly. &#x201c;Demand for resources to support her rapid industrialization. Japan&#x2019;s military leadership in 1941 was filled with a sense of their own manifest destiny. I believe China&#x2019;s leaders are driven not only by national pride, but also fear. If their economy falters, they risk losing power. If it collapses, the nation could go with it. For the Chinese leadership, aggression in the South China Sea presents fewer risks.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dr. Komamura, how did you first contact the Japanese Maritime Defense Force?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They contacted me,&#x201d; Komamura answered. &#x201c;After <i>Navies</i> was published, I gave lectures at several naval bases and the academy at Etajima. After a lecture at Yokosuka, I participated in a long discussion on naval developments with a small group of officers. Admiral Kubo himself joined the group for a short while. Afterwards, I was approached by one of his aides.&#x201d; <br>Hieu looked at the other two admirals, who both nodded firmly. He turned back to Komamura. &#x201c;The original purpose of this meeting was to discuss the concept of an alliance of South and East China Sea littoral nations, an idea you have championed and your Admiral Kubo Noriaki fully supports. Unfortunately, circumstances have changed.&#x201d; <br>Komamura looked confused and uncertain. &#x201c;In what way?&#x201d; <br>Admiral Hieu spoke quickly. &#x201c;Professor, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, with the full approval of the Politburo and the Defense Council, agrees in principle with your &#x2018;littoral alliance.&#x2019; We are ready to work out the details of the collaboration immediately. Every country in the region is threatened by Chinese aggression. Even working together, it will be difficult for us to stop that aggression. Individually, we don&#x2019;t stand a chance.&#x201d; <br>The academic was pleased and excited, but puzzled. &#x201c;But this is wonderful news! I will convey your answer to Admiral Kubo as soon as I return to Japan. But what else has changed?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;China&#x2019;s plans,&#x201d; Hieu explained, &#x201c;and our infant alliance faces an immediate challenge.&#x201d; He turned to the translator. &#x201c;Ask Commander Ty to join us.&#x201d; <br>Commander Ty was in his early thirties, and still had all his hair. While he quickly set up a laptop, the translator hurried over and sat next to Komamura, whispering to the professor as Ty began his brief. <br>&#x201c;Good morning, Dr. Komamura, I am Cao Van Ty. I am assigned to the Second General Department, our intelligence branch.&#x201d; Ty bowed toward the academic, then Admiral Duan, his superior. &#x201c;I will be presenting highly sensitive information about an imminent Chinese threat which affects both our countries. Professor, can we have your promise that you will not share what you learn today with anyone else, unless we give you permission to do so?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Komamura replied quickly. Curiosity filled him, but also foreboding. What was going on? <br>Ty pressed a key and a flat screen at one end of the conference room came alive with a map of the South China Sea. The Vietnamese coast lined the left edge, while Hainan Island was in the center. The Leizhou Peninsula reached out from China&#x2019;s southern coast toward Hainan. The mainland coast angled northeast from the peninsula until it disappeared at the upper right corner. <br>Ty stood next to the screen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re aware of <i>Liaoning</i>&#x2019;s exercises last week.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Their new carrier?&#x201d; Komamura answered. &#x201c;Yes. It was even covered by the mainstream media. Inaccurately, but at least they noticed.&#x201d; <br>Ty continued. &#x201c; <i>Liaoning</i> is now back at her homeport in Yalong Bay. Her captain reports that several minor mechanical issues need to be corrected. He is also loading fuel, ordnance, and the rest of <i>Liaoning</i>&#x2019;s air group. This will consist of ten J-15 fighters, six Ka-28 sub-hunting helicopters, and four Z-8 radar helicopters. He reports they will be ready to sail in five days. <br>&#x201c;When she does sail, she will be escorted by the same six warships that took part in the exercise, three destroyers and three frigates, all armed with advanced guided missiles. The task group will rendezvous with two amphibious ships of the Type 071 class, then proceed to Guangzhou.&#x201d; A line appeared on the chart, starting at the southern tip of Hainan Island, heading north to the naval base at Zhanjiang, where the Leizhou Peninsula joined the Chinese mainland, then north again to the Guangzhou shipyard near Hong Kong. <br>&#x201c;We have photos of a platform being built at Guangzhou.&#x201d; The screen changed to show pictures of a very large, flat structure, spotted with different colors of primer and gray paint. Open girder framework showed in many places. The images were overlaid with circles and labeled in Vietnamese. &#x201c;The shipyard there builds many offshore oil platforms, but this structure is larger, and has a different configuration. But more importantly, it is armed. <br>&#x201c;The circles mark the location of protective fiberglass domes, most likely covering point defense weapons.&#x201d; He pointed to one corner of the structure that did not have a dome. &#x201c;The foundation here is consistent with the Chinese HHQ-10 point defense missile system. These large fiberglass structures near the front are shelters for sensor and communications antennas.&#x201d; <br>Ty pressed a control and the map returned. A bright line led south from Guangzhou deep into the South China Sea. &#x201c;The <i>Liaoning</i> task group will escort the platform, under tow and accompanied by several self-loading container ships, to Thi Tu Island.&#x201d; Ty used the Vietnamese name for the island. The Chinese claimed it as &#x201c;Zhongye Island,&#x201d; but the current occupiers, the Philippines, called it &#x201c;Thitu Island.&#x201d; Thitu was the largest island in the Spratly archipelago, and even sported an airstrip. &#x201c;The transit will take five or six days, depending on the weather. <br>&#x201c;When they are close, marines from one of the amphibious assault ships will seize the island, currently held by about forty Filipino soldiers, and the platform will be anchored at one end of the island. Prefabricated containers carried by the merchants will be placed on landing craft and taken ashore, creating barracks, repair shops, hangars for fighters, and other facilities. <br>&#x201c;Our engineers estimate it will take three days to anchor the structure. Within twenty-four hours after that, the Chinese will have a base defended by an integrated air-defense system, capable of operating a squadron of high-performance fighters and garrisoned by a battalion of marines.&#x201d; <br>Komamura was chilled to the bone. The Chinese had long claimed the entire South China Sea, ignoring other nations&#x2019; borders, but that was only words. A strong military base would let them enforce that claim. Not one of the nations surrounding the South China Sea had the firepower to dislodge such a foothold. The Americans could, but he was convinced they wouldn&#x2019;t risk open war with China, not over a collection of small, disputed islands. Even if the United States wanted to fight, they were unprepared. He was sure the Chinese, with the strategic initiative, would be ready to counter just such a move. <br>&#x201c;But one small island with forty soldiers doesn&#x2019;t require two <i>Kunlun Shan</i> landing ships to capture it.&#x201d; Ty put an image of the ship on the screen. It was a large, modern-looking design. &#x201c;Each Type 071 landing ship dock carries up to eight hundred marines and eighteen armored vehicles. Simultaneous with the attack on Thi Tu, the Chinese will also invade Song Tu Tay Island, also known as Southwest Cay, and Northeast Cay approximately forty-four kilometers to the north. The first island is Vietnamese sovereign territory, the second is Filipino,&#x201d; concluded Ty. <br>The Japanese academic fought to hide his shock and surprise. <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s more,&#x201d; Ty said firmly. &#x201c;Soon a...</p><h2>The Last Days of Night</h2><p>New York, 1888.

In the age of sail they were built in huge numbers and in far greater variety than the more regulated major warships, so they present a particular challenge to any historian attempting a coherent design history. However, for the first time this book charts the development of the ancillary types, variously described in the 17th century as sloops, ketches, brigantines, advice boats and even yachts, as they coalesce into the single 18th-century category of Sloop of War. In this era they were generally two-masted, although they set a bewildering variety of sail plans from them. The author traces their origins to open boats, like those carried by Basque whalers, shows how developments in Europe influenced English craft, and focuses in on the relationship between rigs, hull-form and the duties they were designed to undertake.<br><p>Visual documentation is scanty, but this book draws together a unique collection of rare and unseen images, coupled with the author's own reconstructions in line drawings and watercolor sketches to provide the most convincing depictions of the appearance of these vessels. By tackling some of the most obscure questions about the early history of small-boat rigs, the book adds a dimension that will be of interest to historians of coastal sail and practical yachtsman, as well as warship enthusiasts.</p></p><p>Ian McLaughlan is a retired British Army officer with a keen and active enthusiasm for small-boat sailing. From this passion, he developed a profound interest in the rigs, design and operations of the Navy&#39;s smallest combatants. A decade of study has resulted in this book."Whether you are serious scholar, a devotee of naval history, or just someone who likes a good book, <i>Sloop of War</i> does not disappoint. Most of us can't devote a lifetime of study to this topic, much less gain access to the mouldering records so assiduously researched by the author. Thanks to McLaughlin, we don't have to in order to find out about the interesting history of this class of ship. <i>Sloop of War</i> is at once an extremely detailed academic treatment of early Royal Navy warships, and simultaneously a reference work that could grace any coffee table." <b>--WhatWouldtheFoundersThink.com</b></p><h2>Bloodline of the Holy Grail: The Hidden Lineage of Jesus Revealed</h2><p>A controversial book based on sovereign and knightly archives of Europe and Templar and Vatican records asserts that Jesus Christ had children and his descendants are in the royal houses of Europe. $50,000 ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Laurence Gardner is an internationally renowned sovereign genealogist and historical lecturer. Bloodline of the Holy Grail was a number 8 Sunday Times bestseller (over 250,000 copies in 3 years and serialized by the Daily Mail). His other books include Lost Secrets of the Sacred Ark, Realm of the Ring Lords and Genesis of the Grail Kings.One of the most important developments of the last 50 years in religious studies has been the emergence of suppressed and forgotten texts and lore. A flood of new archeological knowledge and newly discovered ancient texts sheds unexpected light on the traditions of Christian worship. Into this flood, Gardner, who holds the office of the Jacobite Historiographer Royal of the Royal House of Stewart, would like to inject yet another revelation: the bloodline of Jesus Christ. According to Gardner, Jesus married Mary Magdalene, and she was pregnant with his child when he was crucified at Qumran, not Golgotha as it is usually thought. Mary delivered a male child before she and her son were spirited out of Palestine to France, where she died. This child became the scion of an amazing genealogy that terminates?surprise?in the House of Stuart. Furthermore, that house did not expire but flourishes to this day. This book is an amazing patchwork of scholarly trappings and dizzy tomfoolery stitched together with myth and fable until it fabricates the amazing argument that indeed the Crown of England properly belongs to the Line of David through Jesus Christ himself. This is exhilarating fantasy worthy of a great romantic novel. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>KooKooLand</h2><p><b>Gloria Norris&#x2019;s <i>KooKooLand</i> is a&nbsp;memoir written on the edge of a&nbsp;knife blade.

As the child of an English father and a Nigerian mother, Jess just can&#x2019;t shake off the feeling of being alone wherever she goes, and the other kids in her class are wary of her tendency to succumb to terrified fits of screaming. Believing that a change from her English environment might be the perfect antidote to Jess&#x2019;s alarming mood swings, her parents whisk her off to Nigeria for the first time where she meets her mother&#x2019;s family&#x2014;including her formidable grandfather.<br><br>Jess&#x2019;s adjustment to Nigeria is only beginning when she encounters Titiola, or TillyTilly, a ragged little girl her own age.

To Jess, sitting in the cupboard, the sound of her name was strange, wobbly, misformed, as if she were inside a bottle, or a glass cube, maybe, and Mum was outside it, tapping.<br><br><i>I must have been in here too long--</i><br><br>"Jessamy!" Her mother's voice was stern.<br><br>Jessamy Harrison did not reply.<br><br>She was sitting inside the cupboard on the landing, where the towels and other linen were kept, saying quietly to herself, <i>I am in the cupboard</i>.<br><br>She felt that she needed to be saying this so that it would be real. It was similar to her waking up and saying to herself, <i>My name is Jessamy. I am eight years old</i>.<br><br>If she reminded herself that she was in the cupboard, she would know exactly where she was, something that was increasingly difficult each day. Jess found it easier not to remember, for example, that the cupboard she had hidden in was inside a detached house on Langtree Avenue.<br><br>It was a small house. Her cousin Dulcie's house was quite a lot bigger, and so was Tunde Coker's. The house had three bedrooms, but the smallest one had been taken over and cheerily cluttered with books, paper and broken pens by Jess's mum. There were small patches of front and back garden which Jess's parents, who cited lack of time to tend them and lack of funds to get a gardener, both readily referred to as "appalling." Jess preferred cupboards and enclosed spaces to gardens, but she liked the clumpy lengths of brownish grass that sometimes hid earthworms when it was wet, and she liked the mysterious plants (weeds, according to her father) that bent and straggled around the inside of the fence.<br><br>Both the cupboard and the house were in Crankbrook, not too far from Dulcie's house in Bromley. In Jess's opinion, this proximity was unfortunate. Dulcie put Jess in mind of a bad elf--all sharp chin and silver-blonde hair, with chill blue-green lakes for eyes. Even when Dulcie didn't have the specific intention of smashing a hole through Jess's fragile peace, she did anyway. In general, Jess didn't like life outside the cupboard.<br><br>Outside the cupboard, Jess felt as if she was in a place where everything moved past too fast, all colours, all people talking and wanting her to say things. So she kept her eyes on the ground, which pretty much stayed the same.<br><br>Then the grown-up would say, "What's the matter, Jess? Why are you sad?" And she'd have to explain that she wasn't sad, just tired, though how she could be so tired in the middle of the day with the sun shining and everything, she didn't know. It made her feel ashamed.<br><br>"JESSAMY!"<br><br>"I am in the cupboard," she whispered, moving backwards and stretching her arms out, feeling her elbows pillowed by thick, soft masses of towel. She felt as if she were in bed.<br><br>A slit of light grew as the cupboard door opened and her mother looked in at her. Jess could already smell the stain of thick, wrong-flowing biro ink, the way it smelt when the pen went all leaky. She couldn't see her mum's fingers yet, but she knew that they would be blue with the ink, and probably the sleeves of the long yellow T-shirt she was wearing as well. Jess felt like laughing because she could see only half of her mum's face, and it was like one of those <i>Where's Spot?</i> books. Lift the flap to find the rest. But she didn't laugh, because her mum looked sort of cross. She pushed the door wider open.<br><br>"You were in here all this time?" Sarah Harrison asked, her lips pursed.<br><br>Jess sat up, trying to gauge the situation. She was getting good at this.<br><br>"Yeah," she said hesitantly.<br><br>"Then why didn't you answer?"<br><br>"Sorry, Mummy."<br><br>Her mother waited, and Jessamy's brow wrinkled as she scanned her face, perplexed. An explanation was somehow still required.<br><br>"I was thinking about something," she said, after another moment.<br><br>Her mum leaned on the cupboard door, trying to peer into the cupboard, trying, Jess realised, to see her face.<br><br>"Didn't you play out with the others today?" she asked.<br><br>"Yeah," Jessamy lied. She had just caught sight of the clock. It was nearly six now, and she had hidden herself in the landing cupboard after lunch.<br><br>She saw her mum's shoulders relax and wondered why she got so anxious about things like this. She'd heard her say lots of times, in lowered tones, that maybe it wasn't right for Jessamy to play by herself so much, that it wasn't right that she seemed to have nothing to say for herself. In Nigeria, her mother had said, children were always getting themselves into mischief, and surely that was better than sitting inside reading and staring into space all day. But her father, who was English and insisted that things were different here, said it was more or less normal behaviour and that she'd grow out of it. Jess didn't know who was right; she certainly didn't feel as if she was about to run off and get herself into mischief, and she wasn't sure whether she should hope to or not.<br><br>Her mother held out a hand and grasping it, Jess reluctantly left her towel pillows and stepped out on to the landing. They stood there for a second, looking at each other, then her mother crouched and took Jessamy's face in her hands, examining her. Jess held still, tried to assume an expression that would satisfy whatever her mother was looking for, although she could not know what this was.<br><br>Then her mum said quietly. "I didn't hear the back door all day."<br><br>Jessamy started a little.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>Her mum let go of her, shook her head, laughed. Then she said, "How would you like for us to go to Nigeria?"<br><br>Jess, still distracted, found herself asking, "Who?"<br><br>Sarah laughed.<br><br>"Us! You, me and Daddy!"<br><br>Jess felt stupid.<br><br>"Ohhhhh," she said. "In an aeroplane?"<br><br>Her mum, who was convinced that this was the thing to bring Jessamy out of herself, smiled.<br><br>"Yes! In an aeroplane! Would you like that?"<br><br>Jess began to feel excited. To Nigeria! In an aeroplane! She tried to imagine Nigeria, but couldn't. Hot. It would be hot.<br><br>"Yeah," she said, and smiled.<br><br>But if she had known the trouble it would cause, she would have shouted "No!" at the top of her voice and run back into the cupboard. Because it all STARTED in Nigeria, where it was hot, and, although she didn't realise this until much later, the way she felt might have been only a phase, and she might have got better if only <i>(oh, if only if only if ONLY, Mummy)</i> she hadn't gone.<br>Jess liked haiku.<br><br>She thought they were incredible and really sort of terrible. She felt, when reading over the ones she'd written herself, as if she were being punched very hard, just once, with each haiku.<br><br>One day, Jess spent six hours spread untidily across her bedroom floor, chin in hand, motionless except for the movement of her other hand going back and forth across the page. She was writing, crossing out, rewriting, fighting with words and punctuation to mould her sentiment into the perfect form. She continued in the dark without getting up to switch on a light, but eventually she sank and sank until her head was on the paper and her neck was stretching slightly painfully so that she could watch her hand forming letters with the pencil. She didn't sharpen the pencil, but switched to different colours instead, languidly patting her hand out in front of her to pick up a pencil that had rolled into her path. Her parents, looking in on her and seeing her with her cheek pressed against the floor, thought that she had fallen asleep, and her father tiptoed into the room to lift her into bed, only to be disconcerted by the gleam of her wide-open eyes over the top of her arm. She gave no resistance to his putting her into bed and tucking her in, but when her father checked on her again after three hours or so, he found that she had noiselessly relocated herself back on the floor, writing in the dark. The haiku phase lasted a week before she fell ill with the same quietness that she had pursued her interest.<br><br>When she got better, she realised she didn't like haiku anymore.<br>In the departure lounge at the airport, Jess sat staring at her shoes and the way they sat quietly beside each other, occasionally clicking their heels together or putting right heel to left toe.<br><br>Did they do that by themselves?<br><br>She tried to not think about clicking her heels together, then watched her feet to see if the heels clicked independently. They did. Then she realised that she had been thinking about it.<br><br>When she looked about her, she noticed that everything was too quiet. Virtually no one was talking. Some of the people she looked at stared blankly back at her, and she quickly swivelled in her seat and turned her attention on to her father. He was reading a broadsheet, chin in hand as his eyes, narrowed with concentration behind the spectacle lenses, scanned the page. He looked slightly awkward as he attempted to make room for the paper across his knees; his elbows created a dimple in the paper every time he adjusted his position. When he became aware of her gaze, he gave her a quick glance, smiled, nudged her, then returned to his reverie. On the bench opposite her sat an immense woman wearing the most fantastical traditional dress she had ever seen. Yellow snakes, coiled up like golden orange peel, sprang from the beaks of the vivid red birds with outstretched wings which soared across the royal blue background of the woman's clothing. Jess called it<i> eero ahty booby</i> whenever she tried to imitate her mum's pronunciation of it. Sometimes, when her mum was having some of her friends around, she would dress up in traditional costume, tying the thick cloth with riotous patterns a...</p><h2>You Don&#39;t Have to Take it Anymore: Turn Your Resentful, Angry, or Emotionally Abusive Relationship into a Compassionate, Loving One</h2><p>Outlines a program for changing patterns of verbal and emotional abuse in order to help people compassionately recommit to their marriages and families, in a guide that identifies the effects of emotional abuse and demonstrates self-healing techniques for victims. 75,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Steven Stosny, PhD,</b> has treated more than 4,000 people for various relationship problems through CompassionPower, the organization he founded and has directed for more than twelve years.

Flowing floral patterns intertwine with stems and leaves, the smooth satin stitches contrasting wonderfully with the padded, knotted stitchery and untextured background. These natural designs are often fairly large and the sculptured patterns have an appealing bold quality, which is enhanced by the absence of colour and the addition of knitted fringed fringes. Pat Trott explains all the techniques with clear step-by-step photography and inspiring easy-to-follow projects. This book will be welcomed by beginners and also embroiderers of all skill levels.</p><p>Pat Trott was introduced to Armenian needlelace by her mother at a very early age, and this led to her passion for embroidery and stitchery of all kinds. Later, as a skilled embroiderer, she was attracted to Mountmellick because of the numerous different stitches involved, and she went on to become an expert in this unique craft. Pat is a life member of the Embroiderers&#39; Guild and holds regular workshops for many Guild branches, colleges and schools. Pat has had her work featured in Needlework Magazine and New Stitches Magazine.Do you ever cringe at the thought of giving your hand-embroidered masterpeices a good washing - in fact, washing them over and over and over gain? Way over in Ireland, there&#39;s a place called Mountmellick, where, in the early 1800&#39;s, a school was established to teach an affordable embroidery technique to women and girls. What is it that makes Mountmellick embroidery different from other types of whitework? There are actually several aspects of Mountmellick embroidery that differentiate this technique from other forms of whitework. First of all, Mountmellick is not done on linen. Rather, authentic Mountmellic fabric is a heavy cotton jean fabric (not denim, really) - with a nice sheen on the back of it, the side on which the embroidery is done. It&#39;s a durable fabric, and it stands up to laundering. The more it&#39;s washed, the shinier it seems to become. While the material has a nice sheen, the thread is actually matte. This nice contrast is a trademark of real Mountmellick work. In fact, in the era of mercerized cotton (which has a chemically-induced shine), it can be hard to find the proper threads for real Mountmellick work. Good thing there&#39;s Lacis, which does have the matte thread. (Look under embroidery cotton). In many forms of whitework, the designs are somewhat delicate, and cutwork or openwork is often involved. In Mountmellick Embroidery, the designs are definitely bold, and cutwork and openwork are never involved - it&#39;s all straight surface embroidery. The common motifs in Mountmellick Embroidery are taken from nature - flowers, berries, brambles, leaves, stems, etc. The typical stitches are satin stitch (padded), stem or outline, Mountmellick stitch, knots, feather stitch, and buttonhole, and variations on all of these. The edges in Mountmellic embroidery are generally finished with buttonhole stitch or with fringe, depending on how the stuff is to be used. The type of embroidery that flourished in Mountmellick was originally intended to help poor Irish women and girls survive the austere living of the Industrial Age in Ireland. The supplies were inexpensive (not so today - if you want the &#34;real stuff&#34; when it comes to Mountmellick fabric, you&#39;ll pay anywhere from $30 - $50 / yard for it), and the goods were sold, often to visiting Americans, from whence the technique spread in popularity. It&#39;s still a popular technique, and in the embroidery world, it&#39;s enjoying a renewed interest. If you&#39;d like to give Mountmellick embroidery a try, I suggest starting with Pat Trott&#39;s &#34;Beginner&#39;s Guide to Mountmellick Embroidery.&#34; It&#39;s very practical and down-to-earth. She&#39;s got great suggestions for framing up your work for stitching, and a nice selection of authentic patterns and stitches.

While Falco tries to prove that Severina Zotica has murdered her previous husbands, her betrothed is poisoned at a dinner with a notoriously unscrupulous developer and the detective must dig for other motives. Arson, evictions, skyrocketing rents, layered mortgage deals, another murder, near death for Helena and a brutal beating for himself spur Falco to ferret out the truth about the Hortensii and Severina. Period details, humor and Falco's modern sensibility add up to another sterling performance from Davis. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Maya (Ancient Peoples and Places)</h2><p><p><strong>"The gold standard of introductory books on the ancient Maya."&#x2015;<em>Expedition</em></strong></p> The Maya has long been established as the best, most readable introduction to the New World&#x2019;s greatest ancient civilization. In these pages Michael D. Coe distills a lifetime&#x2019;s scholarship for the general reader and student.<br><br> The eighth edition incorporates the latest archaeological and epigraphic research. Among the finest new discoveries are the spectacular polychrome murals of Calakmul, which provide archaeological evidence for the importance of marketplaces in the Classic Maya cities as well as giving a unique glimpse into Maya daily life. Other recent finds relate to the initial peopling of the Maya area by Early Hunters and Archaic peoples.<br><br> It is clear that the birth of Maya civilization lies not in the Classic but in the Preclassic period, above all in the Mirador Basin of northern Guatemala, where the builders of gigantic ancient cities erected the world&#x2019;s largest pyramid as early as 200 BC. In addition, the persistent influence of the precocious Olmec civilization of southeast Mexico on the development of complex society in the Maya area has become more apparent. These and other discoveries continue to suggest that we must rethink what we mean by the term &#x201c;Classic.&#x201d;<br><br> This edition concludes with new historical evidence for the crucial role played by collaborationist native leaders, both Maya and non- Maya, in the Spanish conquest of the region. 20 color and 170 black-and-white photographs and illustrations</p><p>Michael D. Coe is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University. His books include The Maya, Mexico, Breaking the Maya Code, Angkor and the Khmer Civilization, and&nbsp;Reading the Maya Glyphs. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.Because of the wealth of new archaeological data and breakthroughs in the translation of hieroglyphs, Coe's updating of his classic synthesis of Maya civilization provides a valuable service to both informed lay readers and specialists wishing to apprise themselves of the current state of understanding of this most intellectually sophisticated and aesthetically refined pre-Columbian culture. Although the vast majority of the text may be found in the prior edition, the work is transformed by significant interpolations and deletions and is augmented by a new section of color plates, a useful guide for travelers, and a listing of Maya rulers. As it now stands, this refreshed and renewed little masterpiece merits a place in collections serving students of ancient Mesoamerica. Continuing a tradition of massive exhibitions and concomitant exhibition catalogs, the Palazzo Grassi, Venice, has at last discovered the New World. This initial incursion wisely focuses on the most accessible of the great pre-Hispanic cultures, the Maya. In this daunting but unfocused potpourri, some 29 essayists broach nearly the full range of Maya historical, societal, intellectual, political, and artistic traditions with varying degrees of competence. As is common with collective efforts of this sort, one finds both a certain redundancy of elementary facts and a not infrequent inconsistency about the facts themselves. Crammed into the last hundred pages of the volume is the catalog of more than 500 well-illustrated but only perfunctorily documented and analyzed objects. Aside from its value as a remarkable gathering of some 1400 excellent color reproductions, this ill-balanced and ultimately superficial tome has little to recommend it.ARobert Cahn, Fashion Inst. of Technology, New York<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Catalyst Organic Chem Lab Manual</h2><p>Paper is falling out</p><p></p><h2>Set in Darkness: An Inspector Rebus Novel (Inspector Rebus Novels)</h2><p>On the eve of the first Scottish parliament in three hundred years, Edinburgh is a city rife with political passions and expectations. Queensbury House, the home of Scotland's new rulers, falls in the middle of John Rebus' turf, keeping him busy with ceremonial tasks. That quickly changes, however, when a long-dead body is discovered in a Queensbury House fireplace, a homeless man throws himself off a bridge - leaving behind a suitcase full of cash - and an up-and-coming politician is found murdered. The links between the three deaths lead Rebus to a confrontation with one of Edinburgh's most notorious criminals, a man he thought he'd put in jail for life. Someone's going to make a lot of money out of Scotland's independence - and, as Rebus knows all too well, where there's big money at stake, darkness gathers.<br></p><p>Edinburgh police inspector John Rebus's obsession--rock &amp; roll--seems odd for a man whose dark, depressed side is so central to his character, but Ian Rankin always manages to work it gracefully into his noirish novels featuring Rebus. In <i>Set in Darkness</i>, Rebus has a fling with Lorna Grieve, a faded rock muse who's the sister of Roddy Grieve, an up-and-coming politico who turns up dead on the grounds of the boarded-up hospital that's being torn down to make way for the new Scottish Parliament. Grieve's body is the second in the space of days found at Queensberry House; the first was a skeleton bricked up in the fireplace. That decades-old murder seems to be tied to the suicide of a mysterious homeless man whose hefty bank balance is revealed well before his true identity. <blockquote>'So what's the story with Mr Supertramp anyway?'<p> 'He had all this money he either couldn't spend or didn't want to. He took on a new identity. My theory is that he was hiding.'</p><p> 'Maybe.' He was rifling through the scraps on the desk. She folded her arms, gave him a hard look which he failed to notice. He opened the bread bag and shook out the contents: disposable razor, a sliver of soap, toothbrush. 'An organized mind,' he said. 'Makes himself a wash bag. Doesn't like being dirty.'</p><p> 'It's like he was acting the part,' she said.</p></blockquote> There are always plenty of subplots in a Rankin mystery. This time he adds a stalker who happens to be one of Rebus's colleagues, a couple of toughs who hang out in singles clubs and finish their evenings with a rape or two, and the ongoing story of Rebus's tortured past--a bitter divorce, a daughter still recovering from a terrible accident, and a drinking problem. <i>Set in Darkness</i> hit the bestseller list in Great Britain and should enjoy the same success in its U.S. edition. Rankin's ability to keep finding new dimensions in Rebus, handle intricate plot details brilliantly, and evoke the gloom and darkness of his setting keep winning him new admirers, with just cause. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Ian Rankin won England's prestigious Gold Dagger Award for <i>Black and Blue</i>, which was also an Edgar Award nominee. His latest Rebus novel, <i>Dead Souls</i>, was nominated for another Gold Dagger prize. Rankin lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.<br></p><h2>Landscaping for Privacy: Innovative Ways to Turn Your Outdoor Space into a Peaceful Retreat</h2><p><p>The area around your home is your haven, your sanctuary, your refuge from the noise and irritation of traffic, eyesores, and nosy neighbors.

Expelled from the Surrealist movement for his refusal to renounce the theatre, he founded the Theater of Cruelty and wrote <i>The Theater and Its Double</i>, one of the key twentieth-century texts on the topic. Artaud spent nine years at the end of his life in asylums, undergoing electroshock treatments. Released to the care of his friends in 1946, he began to draw again.This book presents drawings and portraits from this late resurgence, all in color.

Th�venin offers a more straightforward biographical and historical account. (It was on the walls of her apartment that Derrida first saw Artaud's paintings and drawings.)

Her books are international bestsellers.Clark's thirty-third book revisits the subject matter of her first (<i>Where Are the Children?</i> 1975), addressing every parent's worst nightmare, the abduction of children. Steve and Margaret Frawley return to their new house after a night out on the town to discover that their three-year-old twins, Kelly and Kathy, have been kidnapped. The kidnappers are demanding an $8 million ransom. As the executives at the company where Steve works debate paying the ransom, the three kidnappers, Lucas, Clint, and Clint's unstable girlfriend, Angie, wait for instructions from the plot's mastermind, who identifies himself only as the Pied Piper. Steve's company agrees to pay the ransom, but the Pied Piper's plan goes awry when Angie decides she wants to keep Kathy and shoots Lucas, leaving a fake suicide note claiming he accidentally killed Kathy. Although she is grateful to be reunited with Kelly, Margaret can't accept the loss of Kathy and clings to Kelly's assertion that she is in psychic communication with her twin. Clark's latest novel lacks the nail-biting suspense of some of her previous ones, but given how the subject matter dovetails with that of her first popular novel, expect interest. <i>Kristine Huntley</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In her novel <em>This is How It Always Is</em> Laurie Frankel takes those real-life experiences and puts them into a big-hearted story of family and secrets. Penn and Rosie are a close, loving couple, living in Madison, Wisconsin with their five boys. But it becomes evident before long that their youngest, Claude, feels like he should have been born a girl. So how do these strong, supportive parents go about helping their son live as the person he wants to be? It&#x2019;s a fascinating thing to behold. The nuances and unforeseen pitfalls of trying to protect your child from fear and hate while nurturing a sense of acceptance is daunting. What is private and what is a secret, and what is, really, nobody&#x2019;s business? Sometimes secrets have a way of materializing in the blink of an eye or the span of an innocuous question, and this novel is about the lengths we will go, as parents and siblings, to protect each other. And how we react when our secrets are exposed. <em>This is How It Always Is</em> in an incredible read that speaks to the heart of what it means to love and be loved by family. <em>--Seira Wilson, The Amazon Book Review</em>Laurie Frankel writes novels (reads novels, teaches other people to write novels, raises a small person who reads and might someday write novels) in Seattle, Washington.

From dressing up for job interviews in a "supporting-a-widowed-mum look" to eavesdropping on dinner guests, she tackles her work with an enthusiasm for discovery. To her descriptions of battles with crazy scullery maids, abusive employers, and unwieldy custards, she brings a humorous and pointed commentary about the delicate and ongoing war between the wealthy and their servants. Written in 1939, this true-life experience reveals a writer who wasted no opportunity to explore daily lives and dramas. Her keen eye for detail, youthful resilience, and sense of the absurd make <i>One Pair of Hands</i> a deliciously inside look at the households of the British upper-class.</p><p>Great granddaughter to Charles Dickens, <b>Monica Dickens</b>&nbsp;(1915-1992) was born into an upper middle class family. Disillusioned with the world in which she was brought up, she acted out&#x2014;she was expelled from St Paul's Girls' School in London for throwing her school uniform over Hammersmith Bridge. Dickens then decided to go into service, despite coming from the privileged class; her experiences as a cook and general servant would form the nucleus of her first book, <i>One Pair Of Hands</i>,&nbsp; published in 1939. Dickens married an American Navy officer, Roy O. Stratton, and spent much of her adult life in Massachusetts and Washington D.C., but she continued to set the majority of her writing in Britain. <i>No More Meadows</i>, which she published in 1953, reflected her work with the NSPCC&#x2014;she later helped to found the American Samaritans in Massachusetts. Between 1970 and 1971 she wrote a series of children's books known as The Worlds End Series which dealt with rescuing animals and, to some extent, children. After the death of her husband in 1985, Dickens returned to England where she continued to write until her death aged 77."Riotously amusing as the book is in parts, Miss Dickens also manages to make it a social document." &#x2014; <i>The Times</i><br><br>"But over and above its gay adventurousness, its variety of keen-eyed and blithe-hearted experience and its implicit challenge to reflection, this book fascinates us too by its lively and unfamiliar detail." &#x2014; <i>New York Times</i></p><h2>The Bed Book</h2><p>Describes various beds that are much more interesting than beds for sleeping, such as a jet-propelled bed, snack bed, pocket-size bed, and bounceable bed.</p><p>In this work written for the poet's own children, the beds she describes are incredible and amusing.

And though he treasured poetic tradition, his work nevertheless engaged directly with the great issues of his time, from industrialization and the crisis of faith to scientific progress and women's rights. A master of the short, intense lyric, he can also be sardonic, humorous, voluptuous, earthy, and satirical. <br>This collection includes, of course, such celebrated poems as "The Lady of Shalott" and "The Charge of the Light Brigade." There are extracts from all the major masterpieces--"Idylls of the King," "The Princess," "In Memoriam"--and several complete long poems, such as "Ulysses" and "Demeter and Persephone," that demonstrate his narrative grace. Finally, there are many of the short lyrical poems, such as "Come into the Garden, Maud" and "Break, Break, Break," for which he is justly celebrated.Alfred Lord Tennyson (1809a1892) published his first two volumes of poems in 1842, establishing him as the leading poet of his generation.

He reveals how you can begin to understand the real nature of this world by getting to know yourself first. Self-knowledge is a vital stage on the path towards enlightenment. Through step-by-step exercises, His Holiness shares time-honored techniques that will hep you shed your illusions about yourself. With his guidance and gentle encouragement, you too can embrace reality at a more authentic level of being. And, by learning to see yourself as you really are, you will begin to create the world you would like to live in.</p><p><b>His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama,</b> Tenzin Gyatso, was born in 1935 to a peasant family in northeastern Tibet and was recognized at the age of two as the reincarnation of his predecessor, the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. The world's foremost Buddhist leader, he travels extensively, speaking eloquently in favor of ecumenical understanding, kindness and compassion, respect for the environment, and, above all, world peace.<br><br><b>Jeffrey Hopkins, Ph.D.,</b> served for a decade as the interpreter for the Dalai Lama. A Buddhist scholar and the author of more than thirty-five books and translations, he is emeritus professor of Tibetan and Buddhist studies at the University of Virginia, where he founded the largest academic program of Tibetan Buddhist studies in the West. <p></p><b>Foreword</b><p>This book by His Holiness the Dalai Lama stems from a basic Buddhist notion that love and insight work cooperatively to bring about enlightenment, like the two wings of a bird. The overarching theme is that self-knowledge is the key to personal development and positive relationships. The Dalai Lama shows us how, in the absence of true self-knowledge, we hurt ourselves through misguided, exaggerated notions of self, others, external events, and physical things. Even our senses deceive us, drawing us into attachment and negative actions that can only come back to haunt us in the future. The book details how to overcome these mistakes in order to live from a realistic knowledge of our healthy interdependence.</p><p>The first part of this book shows how to draw back the deceptive aspect of our experience like a curtain; other approaches, such as suppressing lust and hatred, may be helpful, but they do not address this root problem. By directing our attention to the false veneer that so bedazzles our senses and our thoughts, His Holiness sets the stage for discovering the reality behind appearances. Our tacit acceptance of things as they seem is called ignorance, which is not just a lack of knowledge about how people and things actually exist but an active mistaking of their fundamental nature. True self-knowledge involves exposing and facing misconceptions about ourselves. The aim here is to find out how we get ourselves into trouble, then learn how to intervene on the ground floor of our counterproductive ideas.</p><p>Buddhist psychology is known for its detailed descriptions of the mind's workings, and His Holiness uses these insights in a practical way by helping readers catch hold of these processes through their own experience. His central theme is that our skewed perceptions of body and mind lead to disastrous mistakes, ranging from lust at the one extreme to raging hatred at the other, so that we are consistently being led into trouble as if pulled by a ring in our nose. By developing insight into this process, we can free ourselves, and those around us, from these endless scenarios of pain.</p><p>This part provides step-by-step exercises to develop our ability to recognize the disparity between how we appear to ourselves and how we actually are. Once we have recognized our warped assumptions for what they are, the second part of the book shows how to undermine them. The tools used to accomplish this transformation are renowned Buddhist reflections for questioning appearances, which the Dalai Lama illustrates with his own experiences. His Holiness guides readers through a variety of practical exercises to help us break down the illusions we have superimposed over and beyond what actually exists, and learn how to act in the world from a more realistic framework. This calls for valuing the interdependence of all things and appreciating the latticework of our relationships for the meaningful contribution it makes to our lives.</p><p>The book's third part describes how to harness the power of meditative concentration with insight to achieve immersion in our own ultimate nature, which undermines our problems at their very foundation. The fourth and fifth parts discuss how people and things actually do exist, since they do not exist in the way we assume. The Dalai Lama draws readers into noticing how everything depends on thought -- how thought itself organizes what we perceive. His goal is to develop in us a clear sense of what it means to exist without misconception. Then the final part of the book explains the way this profound state of being enhances love by revealing how unnecessary destructive emotions and suffering actually are. In this way self-knowledge is seen as the key to personal development and positive relationships. Once we know how to put insight in the service of love and love in the service of insight, we come to the book's appendix, an overview of the steps for achieving altruistic enlightenment.</p><p>This book itself is an illustration of Tibet's contribution to world culture, reminding us of the importance of maintaining a homeland for its preservation. The light shining through the Dalai Lama's teachings has its source in that culture, offering insights and practices that so many of us need in ours.</p><p><i>Jeffrey Hopkins, Ph.D.</i></p><p><i>Emeritus Professor of Tibetan Studies</i></p><p><i>University of Virginia</i></p></p><h2>Thin Air: A Shetland Mystery (Shetland Island Mysteries)</h2><p><p>Ann Cleeves is back with the sixth book in her Shetland series featuring Inspector Jimmy Perez, whom readers will remember from <i>Raven Black, White Nights, Red Bones, Blue Lightning,</i> and <i>Dead Water.</i> </p><p>A group of old university friends leave the bright lights of London and travel to Shetland to celebrate the marriage of one of their friends.

He later wrote for The Sunday Times in the mid 1940s, and then for The Guardian from the mid 1950s until 1970. A key figure in the development of crime fiction, he died in 1971.</p><h2>Alice Medrich&#39;s Cookies and Brownies</h2><p>A scrumptious assortment of more than fifty recipes for simple-to-prepare confections includes a wide range of cookies and brownies to suit any taste, featuring such treats as espresso swirl brownies, snicker doodles, and chocolate decadence cookies. 60,000 first printing.

Too often books dealing with these issues are academically inclined and not accessible by the ordinary reader: that is not the case here. Based on a lecture delivered at GAFCON in June 2018, this book will stimulate thinking and open the eyes of Christians to the dangers of the worldview relentlessly promoted by the media.</p><p>Melvin Tinker is Senior Minister of St. John, Newland, Hull. Other books from EP include What Do You Expect? : Ecclesiastes for Today, Salt, Light and Cities on Hills, A Lost God in a Lost World, Mass Destruction and Touchy Topics. He is married to Heather and has three grown up sons and seven grandchildren."We live in interesting times, times of rapid change where all that is solid seems truly to be melting into air. And, rather than be appalled by this, many in the West greet it as something great and good, even as the magnificent end of history. Melvin Tinker disagrees, and is right to do so. In this brief but pungent critique of our current cultural pathologies, he exposes how stories the wrong stories have come to grip our imaginations, how cultural politics has redrawn the map of perceived reality, and how only the story of Jesus Christ and his church can truly satisfy humanity's deepest longings, intellectual and spiritual." --Carl R Trueman, Professor of Biblical and Religious Studies, Grove City College<br><br>"A very brave, fine book written with keen insight. It explains how an older worldview that once shaped the West and in which many Judeo-Christian ideas were embedded has been superseded by one in which those ideas have been uprooted. The brave new world which is dawning is one in which people liberate themselves, dominate the meaning of reality, and subject God if he is still there to their own ends. In this context, the church is in a decidedly countercultural position. It is here, though, that it really finds its voice. Here it is able to speak into our fragile and corrupting world and speak of the goodness, greatness and grace of God." --David F.

She is smart, angry, won&#x2019;t follow the rules, won&#x2019;t let anyone close, and sees things no one else does. In short, she is a very disturbed girl, and the power of I Kill Giants is its ability to convey the reality of a frightened little girl&#x2019;s pain along with the wonder of her apparent fantasies. Kelly&#x2019;s portrayal of the material is nothing short of literary, echoing the similarly combined elements in Roald Dahl&#x2019;s Mathilda (1988), just as the giants that Barbara describes to her tentative new friend Sophia recall Quentin Blake&#x2019;s illustrations in The BFG (1982). Nimura&#x2019;s line work also retains the jittery quality of the British illustrator&#x2019;s style, creating a world of sharp tension. As Barbara begins to let people in, her insistence that the giants are coming threatens these intensely longed-for relationships. Whether or not they exist, the metaphor of giants to symbolize the vast terrors of a person&#x2019;s inner life has never been better realized. Along with Storm in the Barn (the 2009 Booklist Top of the List winner for Youth Fiction), this is graphic storytelling at its zenith: employing fantasy to offer profound insight and take readers on a deeply emotional journey.

Scott Fitzgerald wrote, Manhattan was transformed by jazz, night clubs, radio, skyscrapers, movies, and the ferocious energy of the 1920s, as this illuminating cultural history brilliantly demonstrates.<br><br>In four words&#x2014;&#x201c;the capital of everything&#x201d;&#x2014;Duke Ellington captured Manhattan during one of the most exciting and celebrated eras in our history: the Jazz Age. Radio, tabloid newspapers, and movies with sound appeared. The silver screen took over Times Square as Broadway became America's movie mecca. Tremendous new skyscrapers were built in Midtown in one of the greatest building booms in history. <br> <br><i>Supreme City</i> is the story of Manhattan&#x2019;s growth and transformation in the 1920s and the brilliant people behind it. Nearly all of the makers of modern Manhattan came from elsewhere: Walter Chrysler from the Kansas prairie; entertainment entrepreneur Florenz Ziegfeld from Chicago. William Paley, founder of the CBS radio network, was from Philadelphia, while his rival David Sarnoff, founder of NBC, was a Russian immigrant. Cosmetics queen Elizabeth Arden was Canadian and her rival, Helena Rubenstein, Polish. All of them had in common vaulting ambition and a desire to fulfill their dreams in New York. As mass communication emerged, the city moved from downtown to midtown through a series of engineering triumphs&#x2014;Grand Central Terminal and the new and newly chic Park Avenue it created, the Holland Tunnel, and the modern skyscraper. In less than ten years Manhattan became the social, cultural, and commercial hub of the country. The 1920s was the Age of Jazz and the Age of Ambition.<br> <br>Original in concept, deeply researched, and utterly fascinating, <i>Supreme City</i> transports readers to that time and to the city which outsiders embraced, in E.B.

Higher one cannot go.<br> <br>STUART CHASE, 1927<br> The Building Boom<p></p> <br>It was the most spectacular decade of building in the city&#x2019;s history. During World War I both commercial and housing construction declined sharply nationwide, with workers and building materials directed toward military mobilization. But after a severe postwar recession, the economy rebounded robustly in late 1921 and for the next eight years a new building went up in New York City every fifty-one minutes, on average. Older buildings were demolished at an equally rapid rate.<br> <br>The Grand Central Terminal Zone was the eye of this hurricane of construction activity. In the years between the opening of Grand Central and the Lindbergh parade, the assessed value of land in Terminal City shot up nearly 250 percent. &#x201c;The city is being rebuilt,&#x201d; wrote The New York Times in late 1926. &#x201c;In not more than half a dozen years the skyline of midtown Manhattan&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [and] Park Avenue has been lifted a hundred feet.&#x201d;<br> <br>The speculative fever was abetted by an acute postwar shortage of housing and office space, and by new sources of investment capital available to real estate developers. &#x201c;The building orgy outlasted and outdid all others in New York real estate history,&#x201d; explained historian Arthur Pound, &#x201c;because ways and means were found for getting the little fellow&#x2019;s money into big deals.&#x201d; The commercial real estate business was no longer governed by transactions between one buyer and one seller. Large landholding companies emerged and sold stock on the open market, making it easier to become a real estate investor &#x201c;than buying sugar.&#x201d; Small investors were also enticed into purchasing mortgage bonds. These were created by splitting up large mortgages into smaller, affordable parcels, a practice introduced years earlier by the New York Central and other big railroad companies. Mortgage companies pledged to safeguard the bond holdings of small investors, promising them that their money was more secure than it would be in the vaults of their neighborhood banks. &#x201c;So assured, a public, ignorant of risk, was drawn into the risky game of real estate speculation,&#x201d; wrote Pound.<br> <br>When the supply of housing and office space finally began to overtake demand in 1927, New York architects and real estate developers remained serenely confident that blue skies were in the financial forecast for years, perhaps decades, to come. After the speculative bubble burst in October 1929, the solemn guarantees of the bond hucksters proved worthless, and investors, small and large, were ruined. But in the buoyant 1920s, such a bleak scenario was beyond imagining for most New Yorkers.<br> <br>The building boom fed on itself. Spiraling land values drove up taxes on older rental properties, providing incentive for owners of prime Manhattan real estate to build taller buildings, with more rental space, on their heavily taxed sites. City government poured oil on the fire. In 1921, in response to the housing shortage, it exempted new residential construction from real estate taxes for a period of ten years. No single piece of legislation in New York history gave a greater boost to the city&#x2019;s construction industry. In the 1920s, New York City would account for fully 20 percent of all new residential construction in the country. Builders of large apartment houses were the pacesetters. In 1926, 77 percent of all new residential construction was given over to apartment dwellings.<br> <br>The following year only five new single-family houses were built in all of Manhattan; and for half of that year, the city&#x2019;s Building Department failed to receive a single application for a permit to put up a private house. Almost none of the new money available for housing went to the construction of apartments for the needy. The returns were vastly greater on high-end construction on Park Avenue than they would have been on modest apartments on the Lower East Side. Here, as in nearly every other sector of the city&#x2019;s commercial culture, profit ruled.<br> <br>Development along Park Avenue was accelerated and given a distinctive cast by circumstances peculiar to its real estate market. In any large, thickly settled city, it is exceedingly difficult for a developer to acquire separate, but contiguous, parcels of real estate in order to assemble a building lot of sufficient size to put up a big revenue-generating building. This was the attraction of land leased from the New York Central&#x2019;s real estate company. The sole owner of a million square feet of prime Midtown land, the Central leased this land and the air rights over it in large, sometimes block-size, parcels. Urban land offered in this way&#x2014;already assembled into big lots ready for development&#x2014;was deeply attractive to speculative builders. But only to those with the means and incentive to construct the kind of housing that yielded the highest return on investment: apartments for the hugely rich.<br> <br>By leasing rather than selling its air rights, the company was able to &#x201c;exercise a strict supervision over the architectural features of the buildings.&#x201d; This was important to sharp-eyed capitalists like J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller. Stockholders in the New York Central&#x2019;s real estate company, they also lived in the vicinity of the terminal and were interested in upgrading the area. Though unimaginatively similar in style, the buildings constructed on Grand Central property were among the most substantial and richly appointed in the city, establishing Park Avenue&#x2019;s reputation as the world&#x2019;s most fashionable apartment thoroughfare. &#x201c;Windows and prim greenery and tall, graceful, white facades rise up from either side of the asphalt stream,&#x201d; wrote Zelda Fitzgerald, &#x201c;while in the center floats&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a thin series of watercolor squares of grass&#x2014;suggesting the Queen&#x2019;s Croquet Ground in Alice in Wonderland.&#x201d;<br> Mansions in the Sky<p></p> <br>By 1927, the commanding apartment buildings along Park Avenue were not just tall; they were immensely tall, true towers, the first skyscrapers built for permanent living. The tallest of them was the Ritz Tower, shooting up from the pavement at the corner of Fifty-seventh Street and Park Avenue. Built for bluebloods and tycoons by Emery Roth, an immigrant Jew from Eastern Europe, it opened in October 1926 and was one of the first residential buildings in New York constructed in sympathy with the city&#x2019;s landmark zoning law of 1916.<br> <br>Concerned about diminishing sunlight and fresh air in the canyonlike streets created by the closely massed skyscrapers of lower Manhattan, the city placed a limit on the maximum height and bulk of tall buildings. Height limits were based upon the width of the street a building faced; if a developer proposed to exceed the legal limit, the stories above it had to be set back, roughly one foot for each four feet of additional height. Skyscrapers could be of any height, provided they occupied no more than a quarter of their lot.<br> <br>Forced to work within the confines of the so-called zoning envelope, architects began constructing &#x201c;set-back&#x201d; skyscrapers, with sections of the buildings set back further and further as they rose from their bases into the island&#x2019;s sky. &#x201c;Wedding cake&#x201d; architecture, some New Yorkers called it; others compared the new-style skyscrapers to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon with their ascending terraces. Great parts of Midtown were being transformed from &#x201c;brownstone into Babylon,&#x201d; said The New York Times.<br> <br>Unlike apartment houses built only five years earlier on Park and upper Fifth Avenues, most of them twelve to fifteen stories. The Ritz Tower, however, was forty-one stories high. The tallest inhabited building in the world, it dominated the skyline of Midtown Manhattan as the Woolworth Building did that of lower Manhattan. Residents of its upper stories had unobstructed views in all directions for a distance of twenty-five miles on clear days, &#x201c;panorama[s] unexcelled in all New York,&#x201d; Emery Roth boasted.<br> <br>It was a new way of living for the rich. They became sky dwellers, their &#x201c;mansions in the clouds&#x201d; higher than anyone had ever lived. In its architectural aspirations alone, the Ritz Tower expressed the shoot-for-the-moon spirit of the Jazz Age. Sculpted in rusticated limestone, it rose from its base &#x201c;like a telescope,&#x201d; up through its set-back terraces to a square tower crowned by a glistening copper roof.<br> <br>Arthur Brisbane, the internationally known newspaper mogul, had commissioned the building. He wanted to live in it and make money from it. The former editor of William Randolph Hearst&#x2019;s New York Evening Journal, flagship of the Hearst newspaper chain, Brisbane authored a column, &#x201c;Today,&#x201d; that was syndicated in two hundred Hearst papers, and lately had become editor of Hearst&#x2019;s racy tabloid, the New York Daily Mirror. Both he and his boss, close friends who had flirted with socialism in their youth, were aggressive investors in Manhattan real estate, partners in Hearst-Brisbane Properties and developers of the Ziegfeld Theatre and the Warwick Hotel on the West Side.<br> <br>The Ritz Tower was a residential hotel: a type of urban living that had arisen in America in the late nineteenth century and become increasingly popular in 1920s Manhattan. Property taxes, keyed to skyrocketing real estate values, made the urban palaces along Fifth Avenue, north of Forty-second Street, prohibitively expensive to maintain, even for the Vanderbilts. One by one, owners of these ponderous mansions, many of them widows, sold them to real estate speculators and moved to residence hotels along Park Avenue. But the very rich lived in their sky houses only part of the year. Wives, children, and grandchildren spent entire summers abroad or at waterfront &#x201c;cottages&#x201d; in Newport, Rhode Island, and newly fashionable Palm Beach, Florida. Working fathers and sons stayed in Manhattan and joined their families at their summer retreats for weekends and extended vacations. In September, families reunited on Park Avenue for the city&#x2019;s obligatory social season, either in residence hotels or in their elegant cousins that took in both resident and transient guests: the Barclay, the Park Lane, and the Drake, names associated with exclusivity and extravagance. &#x201c;In town it is no longer quite in taste to build marble palaces, however much money one may have. Instead one lives in a hotel,&#x201d; said a Manhattan social arbiter. It was the height of convenience for those who could afford it. Families could close down their summer homes and arrive at their Park Avenue hotel an hour behind their moving truck and baggage. They could then dress for dinner &#x201c;with a full complement of maids and valets&#x2014;members of the house staff&#x2014;and thereafter continue their accustomed mode of life without the slightest break in the calm course of their living. A pen and a check book,&#x201d; said one writer, &#x201c;are the sole requisites of housekeeping or home making.&#x201d;<br> <br>But the outstanding attraction of the luxury apartment was the merging of mansion and flat. As the editors of Interior Architecture explained, &#x201c;The city dweller finds combined in the apartment hotel the quiet, the permanence, and, to a certain extent, at least, the personality, of his own house with the conveniences and freedom from responsibility supplied by hotel service, brought to its present perfection.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the age of the apartment,&#x201d; declared Elsie de Wolfe, the city&#x2019;s foremost interior designer. &#x201c;Modern women demand simplified living, and the apartment reduces the mechanical business of living to its lowest terms.&#x201d; Nowhere more than at the Ritz Tower. Arthur Brisbane hired the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, owners of Manhattan&#x2019;s ultra-exclusive Ritz-Carlton Hotel, to manage it. The company ran it like a luxury hostelry, providing residents with full hotel amenities, including maid service, barber and beauty shops, three first-class restaurants, and an Italian tea garden entered through a Florentine gateway. The suites ranged in size from one to eighteen rooms and had serving pantries rather than kitchens. Meals were prepared in a basement kitchen and sent up to the floors on swift, electrically heated dumbwaiters. Servants delivered them to the apartments. When residents desired a different dining experience, they had their chauffeurs drive them down the avenue to the Crillon Restaurant, in the McKim, Mead &amp; White&#x2013;designed Hecksher Apartments, or to the fashionable Marguery, just across the street.<br> <br>The Ritz Tower commission was a career breakthrough for Emery Roth, a Hungarian Jew relatively unknown in Manhattan in 1925. Roth was entirely self-trained. In 1884, he arrived in America at age thirteen with only seven dollars in his pocket, a dreamy romantic who loved to paint and draw. His father had died suddenly that year, and his mother, burdened with seven other children, could no longer afford to support him at a Budapest gymnasium on the paltry salary she earned as a village innkeeper. He settled first in Chicago, where he supported himself as a shoeshine boy, and later as a barber&#x2019;s apprentice. Eventually, he found steady work as a draftsman in the office of the firm of Daniel H. Burnham and John Wellborn Root, principal designers of the White City for the World&#x2019;s Columbian Exposition of 1893. &#x201c;No technical or art school could have afforded me greater opportunities for advancement in design than the two years I spent on that job,&#x201d; Roth wrote in his unpublished memoirs. He called the Chicago fair his &#x201c;Alma Mater.&#x201d; The austere classicism of its exposition buildings had a lasting influence on him.<br> <br>When the fair closed in the fall of 1893, Roth moved to New York and secured a minor position in the firm of Richard Morris Hunt, architect of one of the White City&#x2019;s exposition buildings. After Hunt died in 1895, Roth formed his own architectural firm. In 1900, after designing the ten-story Belleclaire apartments on upper Broadway&#x2014;a jewel of a building&#x2014;he began receiving commissions from the Bing brothers, Leo and Alexander, whose real estate firm, Bing &amp; Bing, specialized in the construction of apartment buildings in New York&#x2019;s outer boroughs. When the building recession ended, Roth was one of the chief beneficiaries. &#x201c;The construction boom is on,&#x201d; he wrote excitedly at the time. &#x201c;God only knows when it will stop.&#x201d;<br> <br>An aggressive self-promoter, Roth found himself awash in commissions&#x2014;from Bing &amp; Bing as well as other Jewish developers, many of them fellow �migr�s from Eastern Europe. In 1924, he was actively seeking work in new territory&#x2014;Midtown Manhattan&#x2014;when he landed the Ritz commission. Two years later he collaborated with Bing &amp; Bing on three impressive apartment hotels: the Dorset, at 30 West Fifty-fourth Street; the twenty-story Hotel Drake, a block south of the Ritz Tower; and the Hotel Alden on Central Park West. All bear the mark of Roth&#x2019;s reverence for the Italian Renaissance.<br> <br>The Drake and the Dorset exemplify what Roth is best known for&#x2014;not soaring originality but what has been called the &#x201c;ensemble&#x201d; effect.

But a few paragraphs into the first page, it&#39;s clear that Anne Rice&#39;s son&#39;s first novel isn&#39;t about vampires or witches and does not otherwise read like one of her exceedingly popular books. The only family resemblance is in the setting, the sexual orientation of the lovingly described male characters, and the scent of overripe magnolias.There&#39;s murder, suicide, and madness at the heart of this rather clumsycoming-of-age story, which focuses on the youthful friendship of Stephen Conlin, Meredith Ducote, Greg Darby, and Brandon Charbonnet. This friendship is destroyed by a sexual incident that takes place just before the foursome enters Cannon, an exclusive prep school. There, Stephen is ostracized by his former friends, now the most popular kids on campus, who&#39;d just as soon forget their own complicity in the event. Envy, passion, and rage drive the narrative, but the emotions are as juvenile as the characters, and the long passages depicting the rituals and cruelties of high school, from pep rallies to football games, slow down the pace without really illuminating character or motivation. The novel reads like a roman � clef. Rice might have been wiser to tell someone else&#39;s story rather than his own. --Jane Adams</p><p>Christopher Rice is the son of the novelist, Anne Rice, and the poet, Stan Rice. He is presently living in New Orleans, where he grew up. A Density of Souls is his debut novel.James Daniels is the voice of grief and fear in this thriller about four teenagers caught in a web of lies. In high school the four friends are forever changed by violent deaths that are discovered to be murders. Five years later, they rejoin to solve the mystery but discover that only deeper secrets have emerged. Such a rich cast of characters presents a real challenge to any reader, but Daniels pulls this audiobook off with professionality and ingenuity. His careful vocal delineation of characters results in a colorful production that is engaging. . .while scaring the pants off you at the same time.

Brian Arthur puts forth the first complete theory of the origins and evolution of technology, in a major work that achieves for the invention of new technologies what Darwin&#x2019;s theory achieved for the emergence of new species. <br> <br>Brian Arthur is a pioneer of complexity theory and the discoverer of the highly influential "theory of increasing returns," which took Silicon Valley by storm, famously explaining why some high-tech companies achieve breakaway success. Now, in this long-awaited and ground-breaking book, he solves the great outstanding puzzle of technology&#x2014;where do transformative new technologies come from?&#x2014;putting forth the first full theory of how new technologies emerge and offering a definitive answer to the mystery of why some cultures&#x2014;Silicon Valley, Cambridge, England in the 1920s&#x2014;are so extraordinarily inventive. He has discovered that rather than springing from insight moments of individual genius, new technologies arise in a process akin to evolution. Technology evolves by creating itself out of itself, much as a coral reef builds itself from activities of small organisms. <br> <br>Drawing on a wealth of examples, from the most ancient to cutting-edge inventions of today, Arthur takes readers on a delightful intellectual journey, bringing to life the wonders of this process of technological evolution. <i>The Nature of Technology </i>is the work of one of our greatest thinkers at the top of his game, composing a classic for our times that is sure to generate wide acclaim.</p><p><b> <br>W. Brian Arthur </b>is a professor at the Santa Fe Institute and a visiting researcher at Xerox Parc. Formerly a professor of economics at Stanford University, he was awarded the prestigious Schumpeter Prize in economics and the inaugural Lagrange Prize in complexity science. He has been profiled in <i>Fortune </i>and <i>Wired </i>and has written for <i>Scientific American</i>, <i>Science</i>, and the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. He lives in Palo Alto, California.<p> <b>1 </b></p><p><b> Questions</b> </p><p> I have many attitudes to technology. I use it and take it for granted. I enjoy it and occasionally am frustrated by it. And I am vaguely suspicious of what it is doing to our lives. But I am also caught up by a wonderment at technology, a wonderment at what we humans have created. Recently researchers at the University of Pittsburgh developed a technology that allows a monkey with tiny electrodes implanted in its brain to control a mechanical arm. The monkey does this not by twitching or blinking or making any slight movement, but by using its thoughts alone. </p><p> The workings behind this technology are not enormously complicated. They consist of standard parts from the electronics and robotics repertoires: circuits that detect the monkey's brain signals, processors and mechanical actuators that translate these into mechanical motions, other circuits that feed back a sense of touch to the monkey's brain. The real accomplishment has been to understand the neural circuits that "intend" motion, and tap into these appropriately so that the monkey can use these circuits to move the arm. The technology has obvious promise for impaired people. But that is not what causes me wonder. I wonder that we can put together circuits and mechanical linkages -- in the end, pieces of silicon and copper wiring, strips of metal and small gears -- so that machinery moves in response to thought and to thought alone. </p><p> I wonder at other things we can do. We put together pieces of metal alloy and fossil fuel so that we hurtle through the sky at close to the speed of sound; we organize tiny signals from the spins of atomic nuclei to make images of the neural circuits inside our brains; we organize biological objects -- enzymes -- to snip tiny slivers of molecules from DNA and paste them into bacterial cells. Two or three centuries ago we could not have imagined these powers. And I find them, and how we have come by them, a wonder. </p><p> Most of us do not stop to ponder technology. It is something we find useful but that fades to the background of our world. Yet -- and this is another source of wonder for me -- this thing that fades to the background of our world also creates that world. It creates the realm our lives inhabit. If you woke some morning and found that by some odd magic the technologies that have appeared in the last six hundred years had suddenly vanished: if you found that your toilet and stove and computer and automobile had disappeared, and along with these, steel and concrete buildings, mass production, public hygiene, the steam engine, modern agriculture, the joint stock company, and the printing press, you would find that our modern world had also disappeared. You -- or we, if this strange happening befell all of us -- would still be left with our ideas and culture, and with our children and spouses. And we would still have technologies. We would have water mills, and foundries, and oxcarts; and coarse linens, and hooded cloaks, and sophisticated techniques for building cathedrals. But we would once again be medieval. </p><p> Technology is what separates us from the Middle Ages; indeed it is what separates us from the way we lived 50,000 or more years ago. More than anything else technology creates our world. It creates our wealth, our economy, our very way of being. </p><p> What then is this thing of such importance? What is technology in its nature, in its deepest essence? Where does it come from? And how does it evolve? </p><p> These are the questions I will ask in this book. <br> </p><p> Maybe we can simply accept technology and not concern ourselves much with the deeper questions behind it. But I believe -- in fact I believe fervently -- that it is important to understand what technology is and how it comes to be. This is not just because technology creates much of our world. It is because technology at this stage in our history weighs on us, weighs on our concerns, whether we pay attention to it or not. Certainly technology has enabled our children to survive where formerly they might have died; it has prolonged our own lives and made them a great deal more comfortable than those of our ancestors just two or three centuries ago; it has brought us prosperity. But it has also brought us a profound unease. </p><p> This unease does not just come from a fear that technologies cause new problems for every problem they solve. It wells up also from a deeper and more unconscious source. We place our hopes in technology. We hope in technology to make our lives better, to solve our problems, to get us out of predicaments, to provide the future we want for ourselves and our children. Yet, as humans, we are attuned not to this thing we hope in -- not to technology -- but to something different. We are attuned in the deepest parts of our being to nature, to our original surroundings and our original condition as humankind. We have a familiarity with nature, a reliance on it that comes from three million years of at-homeness with it. We trust nature. When we happen upon a technology such as stemcell regenerative therapy, we experience hope. But we also immediately ask how natural this technology is. And so we are caught between two huge and unconscious forces: Our deepest hope as humans lies in technology; but our deepest trust lies in nature. These forces are like tectonic plates grinding inexorably into each other in one long, slow collision. </p><p> The collision is not new, but more than anything else it is defining our era. Technology is steadily creating the dominant issues and upheavals of our time. We are moving from an era where machines enhanced the natural -- speeded our movements, saved our sweat, stitched our clothing -- to one that brings in technologies that resemble or replace the natural -- genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, medical devices implanted in our bodies. As we learn to use these technologies, we are moving from using nature to intervening directly within nature. And so the story of this century will be about the clash between what technology offers and what we feel comfortable with. No one claims that the nature and workings of technology are simple; there is no reason to think they are simpler than the nature and workings of the economy or of the law. But they are determining for our future and our anxieties about it. </p><p> This book is not about the benefits or evils of technology, there are other books that look at these. It is an attempt to understand this thing that creates so much of our world and causes us so much unconscious unease. </p><p> And this brings us back to the same questions. What is technology? What is it in the deepest sense of its nature? What are its properties and principles? Where does it come from -- how does it come into being? How does it develop? And how does it evolve? <b></b></p><p><b> Missing: An "-ology" of Technology </b> </p><p> One good place to start is to ask what we really know about technology. The reader might expect the answer here to be straightforward, but actually it is not. In fact it is almost paradoxical: we know a great deal about technology and we know little. We know a great deal about technologies in their individual sense, but much less about technology in the way of general understandings. We know all the particularities about the individual methods and practices and machinery we use -- or at least some people, the designers of these, do. We know every step in the production of a computer microprocessor, and every part of the processor, and every part of every part. We know exactly how the processor operates, and all the pathways of the electrons inside it. And we know how the processor fits with the other components in a computer, how it interfaces with the BIOS chip and the interrupt controller. We know exactly these things -- exactly what lies within each technology -- because we have placed them all there in all their detail. Technology in fact is one of the most completely known parts of the human experience. Yet of its essence -- the deep nature of its being -- we know little. </p><p> This sort of contrast between known content and less-known principles is not rare. Around two centuries ago, in the time of the French zoologist Georges Cuvier, biology (or natural history as it was then called) was a vast body of knowledge on individual species and their comparative anatomy and their interrelations. "Today," he said, writing in 1798, "comparative anatomy has reached such a point of perfection that, after inspecting a single bone, one can often determine the class, and sometimes even the genus of the animal to which it belonged." Cuvier was only slightly exaggerating. Naturalists did have detailed knowledge, and they were deeply aware of the family relationships among animals. But they had few principles to hold all this knowledge together. They had no clear idea of how animals had come to be; no mechanism by which evolution -- if it existed -- could work; no obvious idea of whether animals could modify their parts or how this could happen. All this came later, as principles were found. </p><p> We are in the same position with technology. We have detailed studies about the history of individual technologies and how they came into being. We have analyses of the design process; excellent work on how economic factors influence the design of technologies, how the adoption process works, and how technologies diffuse in the economy. We have analyses of how society shapes technology, and of how technology shapes society. And we have meditations on the meaning of technology, and on technology as determining -- or not determining -- human history. But we have no agreement on what the word "technology" means, no overall theory of how technologies come into being, no deep understanding of what "innovation" consists of, and no theory of evolution for technology. Missing is a set of overall principles that would give the subject a logical structure, the sort of structure that would help fill these gaps. </p><p> Missing, in other words, is a theory of technology -- an "-ology" of technology. </p><p> There is no clear reason why this ...</p></p><h2>Grasses and Rushes of Maine</h2><p>Grasses and Rushes of Maine is a comprehensive field guide for all species of grass (family Poaceae) and rush (family Juncaceae) currently found in the state of Maine.

He is the only coach who can claim to be the winningest coach at two different SEC schools, and the only person who has won both the Heisman Trophy as a player and a national championship as a coach. Or who has won a Heisman and coached a Heisman winner.<br><br>From the beginning, Spurrier didn't want to sound like other coaches, dress like other coaches, and, especially, coach like other coaches. As a controversial football pioneer, he ushered in a different style of leadership and play. Spurrier's press conferences were glorious -- he refused to lapse into coachspeak and was always entertaining, although he took his football very seriously. He was known for his fierce competitiveness, roaming up and down the sidelines, often throwing his signature visor to the ground in disgust. Now resigned from coaching at age 70 -- he doesn't like to say "retired" yet -- Spurrier has calmed down, but don't mistake that for a lack of fire. He can be just as feisty as the day he set foot on the East Tennessee dirt in Johnson City's Kiwanis Park, where he grew up to become one of the state's all-time greatest athletes, and went on to play for Florida where he launched one of sports history's all-time great careers.<br><br>In his memoir, Spurrier talks for the first time about the circumstances under which he unexpectedly became a coach and why he resigned at South Carolina. He explains his unique style, the difference between winners and losers, his relationship with the media, why he follows the wisdom of ancient philosophers and warriors, his affinity everything taught by John Wooden, and the reasons behind his relaxed regimen for living well. Spurrier, as always, speaks candidly, bringing together his thoughts about his words, actions, and achievements, while telling countless wonderful anecdotes.</p><p><b>Steve Spurrier</b> is a former football coach and player.

The Yooks and Zooks share a love of buttered bread, but animosity brews between the two groups because they prefer to enjoy the tasty treat differently. The timeless and topical rhyming text is an ideal way to teach young children about the issues of tolerance and respect. Whether in the home or in the classroom, <i>The Butter Battle Book</i> is a must-have for readers of all ages.</p><p>A cautionary Cold War tale (first told by Dr. Seuss back in 1984), <i>The Butter Battle Book</i> still has a lot to teach about intolerance and how tit-for-tat violence can quickly get out of hand. Explaining the very serious differences between the Zooks and the Yooks, a Zook grandpa tells his grandchild the unspeakable truth: "It's high time that you knew of the terribly horrible thing that Zooks do. In every Zook house and every Zook town <i>every Zook eats his bread with the butter side down!</i>" He then recalls his days with the Zook-Watching Border Patrol, as he gave any Zook who dared come close "a twitch with my tough-tufted prickley Snick-Berry Switch." But when the Zooks fought back, the switches gave way to Triple-Sling Jiggers, then Jigger-Rock Snatchems--even a Kick-a-Poo Kid that was "loaded with powerful Poo-a-Doo Powder and ants' eggs and bees' legs and dried-fried clam chowder."<p> With lots of fun and more-than-fair digs at the runaway spending and one-upmanship of U.S.-Soviet days, <i>The Butter Battle Book</i> makes a chuckle-filled read whether you're old enough to get the historical references or not.

Little did Kramer know that the 1967 season would be one of the most remarkable in the history of pro football, culminating with the legendary championship game against Dallas now known as the &#x201c;Ice Bowl,&#x201d; in which Kramer would play a central role. Nor could he have anticipated that his diary would evolve into a book titled <i>Instant Replay</i>, first published in 1968, that would become a multimillion-copy bestseller and be celebrated by reviewers everywhere, including the <i>Washington Post</i>&#x2019;s Jonathan Yardley, who calls it &#x201c;to this day, the best inside account of pro football, indeed the best book ever written about that sport and that league.&#x201d;<br><br>This groundbreaking look inside the&nbsp;world of professional football is one of the first books ever to take&nbsp;readers into the locker room and reveal the inner workings of a&nbsp;professional&nbsp;sports franchise. From training camp, through the historic Ice Bowl,&nbsp;then into the locker room of Super Bowl II, Kramer provides a captivating player&#x2019;s perspective on pro football when the game was all blood, grit, and tears. He also offers a rare and insightful view of the team&#x2019;s storied leader, Coach Vince Lombardi.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bringing the book back into print for the first time in more than a decade, this new edition of <i>Instant Replay </i>retains the classic look of the original and includes a foreword by Jonathan Yardley and additional rarely seen photos from the celebrated &#x201c;Lombardi era.&#x201d; As vivid and engaging as it was when it was first published, <i>Instant Replay</i> is an irreplaceable reminder of the glory days of pro football.</p><p><p>jerry kramer was a right guard for the Green Bay Packers from 1958 to 1968.

He lives in Boise, Idaho. <br><br>dick schaap (1934&#x2013;2002), a sportswriter, broadcaster, and author or coauthor of thirty-three books, reported for <i>NBC Nightly News</i>, the <i>Today </i>show, <i>ABC World News Tonight</i>, <i>20/20</i>, and ESPN and was the recipient of five Emmy Awards.</p>1<br>PRELIMINARY SKIRMISHES<br><br>FEBRUARY 10<br><br>I drove downtown to the Packer offices today to pick up my mail, mostly fan mail about our victory in the first Super Bowl game, and as I came out of the building Coach Lombardi came in. I waved to him cheerfully--I have nothing against him during the off-season--and I said, "Hi, Coach."<br><br>Vince Lombardi is a short, stout man, a stump. He looked up at me and he started to speak and his jaws moved, but no words came out. He hung his head. My first thought--from force of habit, I guess--was I've done something wrong, I'm in trouble, he's mad at me. I just stood there and Lombardi started to speak again and again he opened his mouth and still he didn't say anything. I could see he was upset, really shaken.<br><br>"What is it, Coach?" I said. "What's the matter?"<br><br>Finally, he managed to say, "I had to put Paul--" He was almost stuttering. "I had to put Paul on that list," he said, "and they took him."<br><br>I didn't know what to say. I couldn't say anything. Vince had put Paul Hornung on the list of Packers eligible to be selected by the Saints, the new expansion team in New Orleans, and the Saints had taken him. Paul Hornung had been my teammate ever since I came to Green Bay in 1958, and he had been Vince's prize pupil ever since Vince came to Green Bay in 1959, and it may sound funny but I loved Paul and Vince loved Paul and everybody on the Packers loved Paul. From the stands, or on television, Paul may have looked cocky, with his goat shoulders and his blond hair and his strut, but to the people who knew him he was a beautiful guy.<br><br>I stood there, not saying anything, and Lombardi looked at me again and lowered his head and started to walk away. He took about four steps and then he turned around and said, "This is a helluva business sometimes, isn't it?"<br><br>Then he put his head down again and walked into his office.<br><br>I got to thinking about it later, and the man is a very emotional man. He is spurred to anger or to tears almost equally easily. He gets misty-eyed and he actually cries at times, and no one thinks less of him for crying. He's such a man.<br>JUNE 15<br><br>Practice starts a month from today, and I'm dreading it. I don't want to work that hard again. I don't want to take all that punishment again. I really don't know why I'm going to do it.<br><br>\I must get some enjoyment out of the game, though I can't say what it is. It isn't the body contact. Body contact may be fun for the defensive players, the ones who get to make the tackles, but body contact gives me only cuts and contusions, bruises and abrasions. I suppose I enjoy doing something well. I enjoy springing a back loose, making a good trap block, a good solid trap block, cutting down my man the way I'm supposed to. But I'm not quite as boyish about the whole thing as I used to be.<br><br>A couple of months ago, I was thinking seriously about retiring. Jimmy Taylor, who used to be my roommate on the Packers, and a couple of other fellows and I have a commercial diving business down in Louisiana. Jimmy, who comes from Baton Rouge and played for Louisiana State University, is a great asset to the business; he's such a hero in Louisiana I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up as governor. We've been building up the company for three years now, and this year, with Jimmy playing for the Saints--he played out his option here and jumped to New Orleans--we should really do well. He'll be able to entertain potential customers, wine them and dine them and take them to the Saints' games.<br><br>I thought of retiring so that I could devote more time to the company. And I would have retired, I believe, or at least tried to shift to the New Orleans team, if a deal hadn't come through with a man named Blaine Williams, who's in the advertising business in Green Bay. We're getting portraits made of all the players in the National Football League, and we're selling them to Kraft Foods to distribute on a nationwide basis. It can be a very lucrative thing for me, so I decided I'd better stay here in Green Bay and keep an eye on it.<br><br>Coach Lombardi heard that I was thinking about retiring--he hears everything--and he suspected I was going to use this as a wedge to demand more money. That wasn't what I had in mind, not this time.<br><br>Still, I haven't heard a word from Lombardi about a contract for this year.<br>JULY 5<br><br>Pat Peppler, the personnel director of the Packers, phoned today and asked me if I wanted to discuss my contract. I told him I wanted $27,500, up from $23,000 last year, and I said it isn't as much as I deserve, of course, but I'll be happy with it and I won't cause any problems, any struggle.<br><br>I mean it. I know I'm worth more than $27,500, but I don't want a contract fight over a few thousand dollars. I can remember what happened in 1963.<br><br>That was the year after I kicked three field goals in the world championship game against the New York Giants, and we won the game by three field goals, 16-7. During the 1962 season, I kicked extra points and field goals, and I was named All-Pro offensive guard, and, in general, I had a pretty good year. I came in wanting a sizable raise, and Coach Lombardi started out with the standard 10 percent he offers when he wants to give a guy a raise. I said I wanted nearly 50 percent, from $13,000 up to $19,000, and he hit the ceiling and said absolutely not. He said he'd give me $14,500 or maybe $15,000.<br><br>In the back of my mind, I was thinking about playing out my option--the one-year professional football contract allows a man to play out a second year at the same salary and then become a free agent, the way Jimmy Taylor did last year--and jumping to Denver in the rival American Football League. Denver wanted me badly.<br><br>Coach Lombardi, with his spy system, found out what I was thinking about. He has a real thing about loyalty, and he got doubly upset. He called me into his office and offered me $15,000 and said, "Look, I'm going to give you fifteen, but you have to take it today. Tomorrow, it'll be down to fourteen." I didn't take it.<br><br>I started training camp without a contract, and Vince made practice almost unbearable. Every block I threw, every move I made, was either slow or wrong or inadequate. "Move, Kramer, move," he'd scream, "you think you're worth so damn much." And the contract negotiations weren't kept at any executive level. They were held at lunch and dinner, at bedtime and during team meetings, and the rest of the coaches joined in, all of them on my back, sniping at me, taking potshots at me. I got bitter, I got jumpy, and then a lot of the other guys, my teammates, began to tease me, to ride me, and the teasing didn't sound like teasing to me because I was getting so much hell from all angles.<br><br>And then I almost exploded. We have a ritual the day before a game. The offensive linemen get together with the defensive linemen and throw passes to each other. We take turns playing quarterback, and you get to keep throwing passes until one of them is incomplete. It's a silly little game, but it loosens us up and it's fun. Every lineman's dream, of course, is to be a quarterback. So, in 1963, the day before an exhibition, we were playing this game, and I stepped up for my turn to play quarterback and Bill Austin, who was our line coach, yelled, "No, get out of there, Kramer, you can't be a quarterback."<br><br>I said, "Why not?"<br><br>And he said, "Just 'cause I said so."<br><br>There was no reason, except for the contract, and this burned me up. Later, Austin approached me in the lobby of the hotel we were staying in, and he said, "Jerry, I want to talk to you."<br><br>I said, "Look, you sonuvabitch, I don't want to talk to you at all. I don't have a word to say to you. I don't want to have anything to do with you. Stay away from me."<br><br>I was out of my head a little bit.<br><br>Bill said, "Now, now, don't be like that."<br><br>"I mean it, Bill," I said. "Stay away from me." I stopped just short of punching Austin.<br><br>That night, Coach Lombardi put me on the kickoff team, the suicide team, which is usually reserved, during exhibition games, for rookies. "The kickoff team is football's greatest test of courage," Lombardi says. "It's the way we find out who likes to hit."<br><br>I knew how dangerous the kickoff team could be. In 1961, when I was kicking off for the Packers, I had to be on the kickoff team, of course. I kicked off once against the Minnesota Vikings, the opening play of the game, and when I ran down the field, I ran straight at the wedge in front of the ballcarrier. The wedge is made up of four men, always four big and mobile men, more than 1,000 pounds' worth. One of the guys from the Minnesota wedge hit me in the chest and another scissored my legs and buckled me over backwards and then the ballcarrier stumbled onto me and pounded me into the ground and a couple of other guys ran over me and stomped me in deeper, and the result was a broken ankle. I missed eight games in 1961.<br><br>And then in 1963, for that exhibition, I found myself on the kickoff team again. I took out all my fury on the field. I was the first man down the field on every kickoff, I hit everyone who got in my way, and after the game Lombardi came up to me and said that he wasn't the vindictive type, that we could get together and settle the contract. I signed the next day for $17,500.<br><br> ***<br><br>Pat Peppler told me today he would check with Coach Lombardi about my demand for $27,500.<br>JULY 7<br><br>Pat Peppler called back. "You can have $26,500," he said.<br><br>"If I wanted $26,500," I told him, "I would have asked for $26,500. If I'd said $44,500, I suppose Lombardi would have come back with $43,500. I want $27,500 without any fuss, without any argument."<br>JULY 10<br><br>"OK, it's $27,500," Pat Peppler said today. "Stop by and sign."<br><br>I'm going to forget that I ever thought about retiring. I'm going to forget that I've got a lot of money coming in. I'm going to forget that I don't really need football anymore.<br><br>I've decided to play. Let's get on with it.<br>2<br>BASIC TRAINING<br>JULY 14<br><br>Practice began officially yesterday for everyone except the veteran offensive and defensive linemen. We don't have to report until 6 p.m. tomorrow, Saturday, but I couldn't wait. I had to go over to the stadium this morning. It's not that I'm anxious to start the punishment, but I figured one workout today and one tomorrow would help me ease into training. Monday, we start two-a-days, which are pure hell, one workout in the morning and one in the afternoon, and if I don't get a little exercise, the two-a-days'll kill me.<br><br>Naturally, I saw Vince this morning. He asked me how I was, and, before I could tell him, he said, "You look a little heavy."<br><br>I guess I am. I was up around 265 a few weeks ago, and I'm 259 now, and I'd like to play somewhere between 245 and 250. I'm not too worried about my weight. I know I've got the best diet doctor in the world. His prize patient right now is a rookie tackle named Leon Crenshaw, from Tuskegee Institute, who reported to training camp a week ago weighing 315 pounds. Dr. Lombardi has reduced him to 302.<br><br>I started off the day by trotting three laps around the goal posts, a total of almost half a mile, not because I love running, but because Coach Lombardi insists upon this daily ritual. As long as he's been here, we've had only one fellow who didn't run his three laps, a big rookie named Royce Whittenton. When Green Bay drafted Whittenton during the winter of his senior year in college, he weighed about 240. When the coaches contacted him in the spring, he weighed 270. They told him they didn't want him to come to camp any heavier than 250, and he reported in the summer at 315 pounds. He made one lap and half of another around the goal posts and then he couldn't go any farther. Lombardi cut him from the squad before he even took calisthenics.<br><br>We had one of our little "nutcracker" drills today, a brand of torture--one on one, offensive man against defensive man--which is, I imagine, something like being in the pit. The defensive man positions himself between two huge bags filled with foam rubber, which form a chute; the offensive man, leading a ballcarrier, tries to drive the defensive man out of the chute, banging into him, head-to-head, really rattling each other, ramming each other's neck down into the chest.<br><br>The primary idea is to open a path for the ballcarrier. The secondary idea is to draw blood. I hate it. But Coach Lombardi seemed to enjoy watching every fresh collision.<br><br>Lombardi thinks of himself as the patriarch of a large family, and he loves all his children, and he worries about all of them, but he demands more of his gifted children. Lee Roy Caffey, a tough linebacker from Texas, is one of the gifted children, and Coach Lombardi is always on Lee Roy, chewing him, harassing him, cussing him. We call Lee Roy "Big Turkey," as in, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you big turkey," a Lombardi line. Vince kept saying during the drill today that if anyone wanted to look like an All-American, he should just step in against Caffey.<br><br>"Look at yourself, Caffey, look at yourself, that stinks," Lombardi shouted. Later, Vince added, "Lee Roy, you may think that I criticize you too much, a little unduly at times, but you have the size, the strength, the speed, the mobility, everything in the world necessary to be a great football player, except one thing: YOU'RE TOO DAMN LAZY."<br><br>During the nutcracker, Red Mack, a reserve flanker for us last year who weighs 179 pounds soaking wet, lined up against Ray Nitschke, who weighs 240 pounds and is the strongest 240 pounds in football. Ray uses a forearm better than anyone I've ever seen; when he swings it up into someone's face, it's a lethal weapon. Red should have lined up against someone smaller. Ray's used to beating people's heads in, and he enjoys it, but he looked down at Red Mack and he said, "Oh, no, I can't go against this guy."<br><br>Red looked up at Ray and said, "Get in here, you sonuvabitch, and let's go."</p><h2>Private Demons: The Life of Shirley Jackson</h2><p>A portrait of gifted author Shirley Jackson reveals her less-public life, including her horrifying descent into madness, and describes her work with the doctor who helped her back to sanity</p><p>A porpoise born to a tenacious goldfish (in the words of one of her sons), Shirley Jackson (1916-1965) early rejected the torch of her family's gracious country-club conventionality. "She would laugh at it, flaunt it, rebel against it. But she would carry her mother within her, an unexorcised demon," throughout her short life. This sympathetic biography confirms that the meeting of Jackson (a loner, whose route led her inward) and Stanley Edgar Hyman ("a bearded, loud-mouthed communist Jew" who thrived on having an audience) set her firmly on her career path. Famous above all for "The Lottery," she wrote plays, short stories, light novels, gothics and science fiction, while Hyman produced some of the most brilliant criticism of his time. For 25 years, surrounded by a coterie of creative people at colleges in New York and Vermont, this improbable couple taught, wrote, argued, emoted, smoked and drank to excess (Jackson alone ate a pound of butter a day)and died too young. They left a mixed legacy: four troubled, "somewhat reclusive" children, and some of the most lively writing of mid-century America. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Although scholarly and well researched, this biography is made highly entertaining by its numerous anecdotes, collected in extensive personal interviews with friends and family of Shirley Jackson. Combining critical analysis with a discussion of her life, this first biography of Jackson reveals how the author of a chiller like The Haunting of Hill House can be the same woman who, in her Life Among the Savages , was a forerunner of Erma Bombeck. It further reveals how Jackson's own volatile lifestyle and diverse personality contributed to her early death, a tragedy not so unlike the frightening conclusion of her widely known story "The Lottery."

Pete wreaks havoc in math; causes chaos in science (Mrs. Magma has a meltdown when he swallows her microscope!); and is a star in art (Miss Crumple finds Pete colorful when he eats all the crayons). As Pete gets his fill of knowledge, he also serves as an impetus for learning rules are made to be broken and there is no end to learning. This new adventure is sure to be another "giggly meal for readers who relish ridiculousness, randomness, rambunctiousness and alliteration."-Time Out New York</p><p>In her own words: "born. bucolic childhood. culture-stuffed adolescence. played piano. stopped. danced. stopped. wrote. discarded writing. drew. reinstated writing. married Tibor Kalman and collaborated at iconoclastic yet successful design studio. wrote and painted children's books. worried. took up Ping-Pong. relaxed. wrote and painted for many magazines.&nbsp; cofounded the Rubber Band Society. amused. children: two. dog: one."<br>In her own words: "born. bucolic childhood. culture-stuffed adolescence. played piano. stopped. danced. stopped. wrote. discarded writing. drew. reinstated writing. married Tibor Kalman and collaborated at iconoclastic yet successful design studio. wrote and painted children's books. worried. took up Ping-Pong. relaxed. wrote and painted for many magazines.&nbsp; cofounded the Rubber Band Society. amused. children: two. dog: one."*Starred Review* Gr. 2-4. Sometimes Kalman's books (and their outrageous humor) seem more aimed at adults than kids. But not this one. Pete, the shaggy dog introduced in <i>What Pete Ate from A to Z</i> (2001), is back--hungrier (and funnier) than ever. This time he goes to school with his owner, Poppy Wise, and her brother, Mookie (nicknamed Shmookie Scalandroopy by his sister), where he gobbles up, among other things, an encyclopedia. His literary indulgence becomes clear to his owners as they study at home that night: Pete not only speaks but also gives them answers to their homework. The next day, the excited Wise children bring Pete to school disguised as their brilliant cousin, Pearl Buttonweiser--but Pete's wagging tail eventually gives him away. The design and the artwork are signature Kalman: inventive, eye-catching, bold yet subtle. Some children may have trouble reading the hand-lettered text, but many will find it worth the effort to catch all the jokes. Readers will also find some interesting information. With so many witty asides and quirky artistic tangents, saying that this will be read more than once is an understatement. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

During their 18 years together, Starcke was transformed into a Practical Mystic.<br><br>\"With simple and deeply personal eloquence, Walter Starcke explores for us a way out of and above the finally fatal world of materialism.\"<br>- Tennesee Williams<br><br>Joel and I is an autobiographical peek into his life-altering, father-son type relationship with Joel Goldsmith, a renowned spiritual practitioner and Christian mystic.<br><br>Starcke was once known primarily for his success on Broadway, where he became one of the youngest ever to receive the New York Drama Critics Award for his production of I Am a Camera, which later became Cabaret. His social circle included literary giants such as Tennesee Williams and Gore Vidal, and the director and playwright John van Druten, who introduced Starcke to Goldsmith, instigating the beginning of his spiritual quest and career.<br><br>Goldsmith s mystical message is described by some as among the most important contributions of the 20th Century, yet few know anything of the man and the price he paid to bring forth his great teaching. Walter Starcke, who was at Joels side for 18 years, traveled with him, and introduced him from the platform on his first talks in New York and London, paints an intimate picture of the ups and downs of his personal relationship with Goldsmith. <br><br>Born into a Jewish family, Goldsmith eventually turned to Christian Science, where he became a successful and respected practitioner, only to lose favor with the denomination when his own spiritual convictions began to filter into his teachings. He went on to found The Infinite Way method, centered on the concept that the truth is found only by becoming one with the subjective through meditation and contemplative practices. <br><br>Joel told Starcke that his message had further to go. Starcke shares with us an over-view of his own message, especially as it relates to his roots. Starckes message that its time to close the gap between our divinity and our humanity, contuinues the Turths revealed in Joels work. It is important to reveal the personal side of Goldsmith in order for his message to be fully appreciated.<br><br>Readers will enjoy the full scope of this book. It is full of personal photos, letters, biographical information, and spiritual insights.</p><p>Walter Starcke s extraordinary life reads like fiction. In his quest for life s ultimate answers and with his uncanny ability to perpetually reinvent himself, he has donned the role of modern mystic, Broadway producer, successful business entrepreneur, powerful keynote speaker and author of six best-selling books, It s All God, The Third Appearance, The Double Thread, The Ultimate Revolution, The Gospel of Relativity, and Homesick for Heaven. <br>As playwright Tennessee Williams wrote of Starcke s unique approach, With simple and deeply personal eloquence, Walter Starcke explores for us a way out of and above the finally fatal world of materialism. <br>In his career on Broadway, Starcke co-produced I Am a Camera, which became the musical Cabaret, and resulted in his being one of the youngest producers to have received the New York Drama Critic s Best Play Award. Starcke also collaborated with the playwright director, John Van Druten on his play Bell Book and Candle, which Van Druten dedicated to him, and served as his Assistant Director on the original production of Roger and Hammerstein s The King and I. Starcke s friends in his theater days ranged from such literary giants as Noel Coward, Cole Porter, and his own peer group of friends Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Marlon Brando, and Paul Newman, who Starcke discovered and introduced to Paul s first agent.<br>His business successes include the establishment of the OLD ISLAND RESTORATION FOUNDATION in Key West Florida, which was greatly responsible for Key West s current popularity. There, Starcke began KEY WEST HANDPRINT FABRICS, which became a national success with outlets across the country and gave birth to the Lily Pulitzer designs. For this, Starcke received the Key West Industrialist of the Year Award in 1962. In 1974, he returned to his native Texas and purchased a 367-acre ranch in the Texas Hill Country, which Starcke transformed into an internationally successful corporate retreat center for Fortune 500 companies.<br>For many years Starcke and his wife, Eron, lived on the Guadalupe River Ranch where they were co-managers and loved the hands on activite. Starcke also started another silk screen business on the ranch, which Eron not only ran, but became a successful designer. Guadaluep Hand Prints became a nationally know custom business with Walter s marketing abilities.<br>Starcke s life was about Trusting the Process and this he successeed in in all areas of his life. The real focus of his life was always his spiritual growth. Starcke s all consuming fire to find universal truths lead him to circle the world a half dozen times to study the major world religions. This trek took him from Lama Govinda s ashram at the border of Tibet to the Vedanta monastery in Southern California, with Swami Prabhavananda, in the days that Aldus Huxley and Christopher Sherwood were there. As Starcke says, they were setting the patterns in the late forties for the explosion of interest in the mystical and metaphysical movement that is taking place today. <br>His mentor and most influential teacher was the Christian mystic and author of THE INFINITE WAY, Joel S. Goldsmith - an association that began in 1946 and lasted until Goldsmith s death eighteen years later. As Joel knew himself, they was much more to reveal and share, which Starcke continued to do through his life.<br>At the INTERNATIONAL NEW THOUGHT ALLIANCE conference in 2001, Starcke was awarded its Mystical Century Award. He holds a Doctor of Divinity degree from Emerson Theological Institute, and was on the Board of Directors for Unity School at Unity Village Missouri.<br>Before his death, he and Eron compeleted his last book, The Star Keys.<br>Starcke indeed closed the gap between our Divine and our Humanity by giving us the Star Keys to make this Process a real possibilityA fascinating book that tells the story of how three amazing men were drawn together in a spiritual quest that has greatly influenced the lives of all of us who are involved in the evolution of consciousness.

Not to need wings because you don&#x2019;t have to fly away from your country?<br></i><br>From award-winning author Julia Alvarez comes the story of Anita de la Torre, a 12-year-old girl living in the Dominican Republic in 1960. Most of her relatives have immigrated to the United States, her T�o Toni has disappeared, Papi has been getting mysterious phone calls about butterflies and someone named Mr. Smith, and the secret police have started terrorizing her family for their suspected opposition to the country&#x2019;s dictator. While Anita deals with a frightening series of events, she also struggles with her adolescence and her own personal flight to be free.</p><p>What would life be like for a teen living under a dictatorship? Afraid to go to school or to talk freely? Knowing that, at the least suspicion, the secret police could invade your house, even search and destroy your private treasures? Or worse, that your father or uncles or brothers could be suddenly taken away to be jailed or tortured or killed? Such experiences have been all too common in the many Latin American dictatorships of the last 50 years. Author Julia Alvarez ( <i>How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents</i>) and her family escaped from the Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic when she was 10, but in <i>Before We Were Free</i> she imagines, through the stories of her cousins and friends, how it was for those who stayed behind. <p> Twelve-year-old Anita de la Torre is too involved with her own life to be more than dimly aware of the growing menace all around her, until her last cousins and uncles and aunts have fled to America and a fleet of black Volkswagens comes up the drive, bringing the secret police to the family compound to search their houses. Gradually, through overheard conversations and the explanations of her older sister, Lucinda, she comes to understand that her father and uncles are involved in a plot to kill El Jefe, the dictator, and that they are all in deadly peril. Anita's story is universal in its implications--she even keeps an Anne Frank-like diary when she and her mother must hide in a friend's house--and a tribute to those brave souls who feel, like Anita's father, that "life without freedom is no life at all."

As long as she's at home with them, Else-Marie finds this perfectly satisfactory; but when Mom has to work overtime so that the daddies are delegated to pick her up at playgroup, Else-Marie suddenly sees her unusual parents as she imagines others will, and is filled with anxiety: Will the daddies be chased by a neighbor's dog? Will they embarrass her in front of her friends? No problem, it turns out: the other children accept the daddies with careless aplomb. Lindenbaum's auspicious debut story, realistic except for the remarkable daddies, is developed with logic and good humor and told in a dry, straightforward, amusing style. Even better are her lively illustrations, in which the unusual family is realized in comical detail; the daddies, like an orderly Cub Scout troop, are delightful. Adults who couldn't accept Stuart Little may worry about Mom; for anyone else, an offbeat treat. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Kindergarten-Grade 2-- Else-Marie has seven little daddies. They are about 16 inches high. They do all the regular things associated with fathers--go off to work, come home on the bus, eat supper, and read the paper. Indeed, their life is so normal that Else-Marie does not in the least regard her situation as peculiar. However, when her mother announces that she has to work overtime and that Else-Marie's daddies will pick her up at playgroup, the child begins to worry that her playmates may find it strange that she has several little daddies instead of one big one. Au contraire , her friends don't seem to mind a bit. All through the story readers will search for a logical explanation, some missing puzzle piece regarding Else-Marie's bizarre situation. However, no answers are provided, no hints are given. This lack of resolution makes for an ultimately unsatisfying story, with awkward attempts at humor. The illustrations, done in a cartoon style, portray rather unappealing characters with bulging eyes and stringy hair, and the colors are murky. --Alexandra Marris, Rochester Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mister Max: The Book of Kings: Mister Max 3</h2><p><b>In Act III of Newbery Medalist Cynthia Voigt&#x2019;s Mister Max trilogy, the solutioneer sets off to rescue his missing parents!</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since Max&#x2019;s parents were spirited away on a mysterious ship, he has longed to find them.<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;s solved case after case for other people in his business as &#x201c;solutioneer.&#x201d; And he&#x2019;s puzzled out the coded messages sent by his father.

She lives with her husband in Maine.1<br><br>In which Max is irritated, frustrated, and thwarted<br><br>Max didn&#x2019;t have to open the envelope to know what it contained. His fingers recognized the button shape, and a wave of bad feelings--mostly sadness and shame--washed over him.<br><br>Max pocketed the button. He didn&#x2019;t need any reminder. Since the April morning when his parents had disappeared--on a ship that didn&#x2019;t exist--Max, along with his grandmother, had worried. At first they worried about what had happened to them, and then, when his parents reappeared in the unlikely roles of King and Queen of Andesia, a tiny South American country, they spent hours worrying about what they should do, and what they could do. Max didn&#x2019;t know why his father kept sending these buttons, with the familiar three-peaked symbol stamped on them.<br><br>They were as confusing as the few letters that had arrived from Andesia. Max had eventually decoded notes that cried Help and Trapped, but nothing telling him how to proceed. Even when he&#x2019;d finally figured out the clues leading to a hidden fortune in gold coins, that had only raised more questions. Where had they come from? How had his father, who earned a good living but was by no means wealthy, gotten them? Why were they hidden away, like some guilty secret?<br><br>No surprise, then, that Max could only guess at what the buttons were supposed to mean. Probably Where are you? Or maybe Where the devil are you? Whatever the precise message, what they hinted at was Max&#x2019;s failure, and he was already sorry enough, every day, that he hadn&#x2019;t yet been able to rescue his parents.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t as if he&#x2019;d been sitting under a tree sipping lemonade and munching on cookies while he read adventure books. He&#x2019;d been busy, figuring out how to earn a living and earning it. He&#x2019;d become Mister Max, Solutioneer, solving problems for the mayor, even. For William Starling&#x2019;s information, that was what his son had been doing. Being independent. As ordered.<br><br>On his way back through the kitchen, Max ripped up the envelope and dropped it into the trash. He didn&#x2019;t plan to tell his grandmother about this one, just as he hadn&#x2019;t told her about the previous two. He poured himself a glass of water and had a surprising and disturbing thought: the envelope had been delivered by hand. This raised more questions. If his father had an ally in the city, why wouldn&#x2019;t that person come directly to Max? Were these buttons a trap being set by General Balcor to lure Max to Andesia, and if so, what did the General plan to do once he had Max and his parents together? Who, besides Max and Grammie and their small circle of co-conspirators, knew about William and Mary Starling&#x2019;s perilous position?<br><br>Everything his former-schoolteacher, former-librarian grandmother had been able to find out about Andesia made them even more uneasy: The narrow country that lay along the high foothills of the Andes had been, since the discovery of veins of silver and copper in its mountains, conquered and re-conquered by strong men, robber chieftains who styled themselves Kings of Andesia and were soon assassinated by the next conquering invader. Recently, not seven months back, when the downtrodden natives had rebelled against their masters, foreign armies had come to the aid of the King. The royal family had been spirited away to safety in a mountain fortress and order had been re-established, the rebellion put down, its leaders hanged in the public square, and a general left in charge. But despite General Balcor&#x2019;s efforts (or perhaps because of them?), the royal family was discovered and murdered. <br><br>Grammie could find out nothing about this General Balcor, other than the simplest facts--Andesian mother, Peruvian father, educated abroad in a suspicious number of different schools. They guessed that his was the shadowy figure in the newspaper photograph Grammie had sighted of the coronation of the new King and Queen of Andesia: William and Mary Starling. The royal couple was smiling down on a crowd gathered to greet them on the steps of the cathedral of Caracas, their hands clasped in a signal Max and Grammie recognized from seeing it as the Starlings took their bows at the end of a bad performance. Trouble, those clasped hands meant. Max and Grammie suspected that the trouble had to do with the barely discernible figure lurking close behind them, a high military shako on its head.<br><br>The coronation photograph had appeared in June, more than a month after the disappearance, and it was now late July. Max had counted off the slow days and the long weeks and he knew just how long a time it had been. He was doing the best he could, as fast as he could. There was no need for anyone, most likely William Starling, fake King of Andesia, to be firing buttons at him. He put his glass down on the counter beside the sink and set his feelings down beside it. He could be angry at his parents later, after he&#x2019;d rescued them. Never mind those buttons, he had work to do.<br><br>Max finally had a rescue plan, and it was a good one: to arrive in Andesia as a member of a visiting foreign embassy. Ari, Max&#x2019;s tenant, math tutor, and the future Baron Barthold would be the embassy&#x2019;s head. Max would act as his private secretary. And Grammie would play the housekeeper. He knew that its best chance of success was if it was an official diplomatic embassy sent by King Teodor III, but he had no idea how to get into the presence of Teodor to even make the request. One thing in Max&#x2019;s favor was that the royal family had arrived for their annual vacation weeks in the summer palace, so the King was nearby. That was, however, the only thing in his favor.<br><br>The summer palace sat on a promontory overlooking the lake, easily visible but thoroughly guarded. During these lakeside holidays, King Teodor and his family could live almost like ordinary people--his children out on bicycles or flying kites, treating themselves to ice cream, going barefoot; he and his Queen out on the lake in a small sailboat, alone together; all of them at the city&#x2019;s best restaurants, just for the pleasure of dining out together as a family. Max needed to think of a way to intrude on the King&#x2019;s well-guarded holiday privacy, and if he could do that, to persuade him to give official standing--nothing more, Max would take care of all the rest--to a rescue party masquerading as a diplomatic embassy. Max had to speak to the King in person, and he hadn&#x2019;t yet figured out how to do that.<br><br>He needed to think hard, so he put on his red painter&#x2019;s beret and took his easel out to the front garden, where Grammie would not see him and come pestering around. That morning, luckily, there was a paintable sky. White fluffy clouds floated through air of a color that only happened in July, a pale blue that seemed to include yellow heat. You looked at the sky and you knew it was going to be a hot day. But not--how could the color show this?--a hot and humid day. This was an interesting painting problem, and Max set to work. His hand would paint, his brain would think, and maybe he would have an idea.<br><br>He was so deeply immersed in the delicate touches that would re-create the puffiness of the clouds that the bell roused him like an alarm in the night. At the sound, Max spun around. He hadn&#x2019;t known that the little bell could clamor.<br><br>A hat was at the gate. The hat was extraordinarily wide and extraordinarily tall and extraordinarily purple. It waved two extraordinarily long and extraordinarily yellow feathers in the air. The feathers were attached to it with the bright green splash of a Z.<br><br>The hat was wearing a rather small woman.<br><br>The woman--who, without being invited in, unlatched the gate and marched onto the path to the front door--was short and round. In a lavender summer dress with a narrow purple belt at the waist, her body was as round as a figure eight. Her face, too, was round and her eyes were round and her little red mouth was almost round. She was not young, not at all young, although she moved up the path and across the grass to where Max stood with the speed and energy of youth. &#x201c;I expect that you are this Solutioneer person,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Max nodded and bit at the insides of his cheeks, to keep from laughing.<br><br>&#x201c;You know who I am,&#x201d; she told him.<br><br>He thought that he might, although it was Pia Bendiff, his assistant, who had handled the correspondence. The woman must be R Zilla, the city&#x2019;s most well-known milliner. He didn&#x2019;t know which was more alarming, her hat or her presence.<br><br>&#x201c;You are not without skill,&#x201d; the woman remarked, staring at his painting as closely as if he had asked for her opinion. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to tell from this. Although&#x201d;--eyes as round and streaky blue as marbles moved to the beret he wore--&#x201c;you have no sense of style.&#x201d;<br><br>Max still couldn&#x2019;t speak, for fear of laughing. There was so much hat to her . . . <br><br>&#x201c;Who is your teacher? To set you such an exercise, he must have a plan. It must be a man, I think. Who is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Joachim,&#x201d; Max answered in a choked voice. He had to gather himself together, he knew. He had to become the Solutioneer, the successful investigator, a professional. He hoped she wouldn&#x2019;t ask him anything solutioneery until he had had a chance to become who she thought he was.<br><br>&#x201c;Joachim works in oils,&#x201d; she told him, as if he did not already know. &#x201c;I once purchased a painting of a branch in winter,&#x201d; she announced, and turned her attention back to Max&#x2019;s skyscape.<br><br>He took a deep breath. While she studied his painting, she made little puffing sounds that emerged like timid kittens from under the purple brim of the hat. He took a second deep breath, and a third. He became Mister Max. He asked, &#x201c;What is it you want of me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see nothing of Joachim in this,&#x201d; she announced. &#x201c;A pity. Does he have a studio?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where would that be? I might be in the market for another of his pictures,&#x201d; she informed him.<br><br>Max was happy to give her the address. He was sending Joachim a buyer, just what the painter needed.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, he&#x2019;s in the New Town.&#x201d; She nodded. &#x201c;A better location than yours, here in the old city.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s actually working in two styles now. There&#x2019;s the old way--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fine details. Rich tones. Painted from life,&#x201d; she told him.<br><br>&#x201c;--and a new one, quite different.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will prefer the old,&#x201d; she declared.<br><br>&#x201c;He usually works in his garden,&#x201d; Max said.<br><br>He had no idea where this conversation was going. They stood side by side in front of his easel. Anyone in the lane would have thought they were discussing the painting on the easel in front of them.<br><br>&#x201c;I expect it&#x2019;s his way of staying away from his family, who would interrupt his concentration,&#x201d; R Zilla said.<br><br>&#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t have a family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I expect he is too young.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Max said.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said then, and turned to look up into his face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s about my niece, Tess Tardo,&#x201d; she announced. &#x201c;The girl has no gratitude. I taught her everything she knows, but she is a quarrelsome and stubborn girl. My youngest sister&#x2019;s youngest child. I took her in. I could do no less, since she has a certain talent. She has acquired necessary skills in my workroom. I trained her,&#x201d; R Zilla told him proudly, then announced, &#x201c;The girl has gone off on her own.&#x201d;<br><br>Max did not need to be told that this displeased R Zilla. Her sharp, quick words did that, but what they didn&#x2019;t tell him was what it all had to do with the Solutioneer.<br><br>&#x201c;Thankless child.&#x201d; R Zilla glared up at him. Her expression changed. &#x201c;You have very odd eyes,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure you can be trusted, with those eyes. They are almost the color of garden snakes,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Much too close to the color of garden snakes, if you ask me.&#x201d;<br><br>Max couldn&#x2019;t help himself. He laughed.<br><br>R Zilla did not like being laughed at. Her mouth pursed up into a wrinkled red prune.<br><br>At least, Max thought, she wouldn&#x2019;t bother him any more about some job.<br><br>But he was to be disappointed in that hope. &#x201c;When will you start on the job?&#x201d; she demanded crossly.<br><br>&#x201c;What job?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Finding her. Well, I know where she is to be found. I&#x2019;m not a total dolt, whatever some people might think.&#x201d; Her glance made it clear to Max just whom she was referring to. &#x201c;I want you to find out about her. I need to know how to get her back. Tess was very good with the girls in the workroom. Which I am not,&#x201d; R Zilla told him, as if this would come as a surprise.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been told that I&#x2019;m not taking any new work,&#x201d; Max reminded her.<br><br>&#x201c;You never told me. It was some assistant telling me that, some secretary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And she was correct,&#x201d; Max said.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time to waste. Who knows what the girl will do? What if she marries? And has to raise children when she should be . . .&#x201d; But here, words failed the old woman and she waved her hands in the air, as if gathering in some unseen flock of possibilities. &#x201c;Tess could be one of the great milliners, like me. But no, the girl has her own ideas. She wants to make hats anyone can afford, even servants and secretaries, even schoolteachers. Well, she&#x2019;ll have learned her lesson by now,&#x201d; R Zilla concluded, with satisfaction. &#x201c;However, she is, as I said, stubborn. I need to know what it will take to persuade her to return to me. Surely you can accomplish that without much effort?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not accepting any work.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll expect to hear from you. You can reach me at the shop, on Barthold Boulevard.&#x201d;<br><br>Max had exhausted both his patience and his faith in a mannerly approach to this woman. &#x201c;Go away,&#x201d; he said to her. Then he couldn&#x2019;t help but add, &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not until you agree,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>He had no choice. He adjusted the red beret, causing her to sniff her disapproval, and turned his back to her. He picked up his paintbrush, dipped it into water, then color, and applied it to the paper. For several minutes, he simply ignored her.<br><br>At last he heard a rustle of skirts and her voice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, Max didn&#x2019;t care if she did return. At that moment, all he cared about was that she stop telling him he had to do something he&#x2019;d said over and over he wasn&#x2019;t going to do.</p><h2>The Discovery of the Nag Hammadi Texts: A Firsthand Account of the Expedition That Shook the Foundations of Christianity</h2><p>Details the momentous discovery and significance of the ancient gnostic texts hidden for sixteen centuries in Chenoboskion, Egypt<br><br>� Author was a member of the party that discovered these ancient Coptic documents<br><br>� Sheds new light on the vanished world in which Christianity was born<br><br>� 40,000 copies sold of earlier editions<br><br>� Includes the first translation of the Gospel of Thomas, with full commentary<br><br>Hidden for sixteen centuries, the Nag Hammadi library, the most prodigious collection of sacred gnostic texts, were discovered in the late 1940s in Chenoboskion, a remote hamlet in upper Egypt.

When you walk into a room or down the street, even without thinking about it, you immediately take note of clothing clues and judge the wearers accordingly. You can usually tell at a glance whether a person is rich, poor, or somewhere in the middle. Often, you can even guess what someone does for a living&#x2014;the messenger with his pants legs rolled up, the businessman in his suit.<br> <br>And yet, it&#x2019;s rare that people think about what their own clothes signify about their place in the world or their priorities. Clothes are self-expression. If you have a limited range of outfits&#x2014;say, only capri pants and T-shirts&#x2014;it&#x2019;s as though you have a limited range of words in your vocabulary.<br> <br>While many historians concern themselves with the dress of indigenous civilizations, the work of certain designers, or with very specific periods in fashion, I am most interested in the clothes we wear right here and now and how various looks came into vogue. My focus in this book is on Western fashion, with a particular emphasis on America. I will look, piece by piece, at the items most Americans have in their closets and ask, &#x201c;Do you know where this garment comes from&#x2014;before Old Navy?&#x201d;<br> <br><i>This old thing?,</i> you may think.<br> <br>My answer is yes. Even that ratty band T-shirt has a fascinating history that goes back far before the Steel Wheels tour. While American fashion is often vilified as sloppy or as the poor relation of Parisian couture, I find it full of surprises, beauty, and history. And I love exploring the ways in which and the reasons why clothing changes over time.<br> <br>Before writing this book, I considered myself to be something of a fashion expert. I was an educator for twenty-nine years, during which I loved learning as much as I loved teaching. And yet, while working on this book, my learning curve has so profoundly accelerated and my body of knowledge has so increased that I feel as though I&#x2019;ve gone through graduate school again! The research required was simultaneously daunting and exhilarating. Every day brought exclamations of surprise and wonder.<br><br>Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis the XVI, in a gown that typified the excess of the French court.<br><br>For example, I have always maintained that fashion is all about context&#x2014;societal, cultural, historic, economic, and political.

The sumptuous gowns during the reigns of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI became so dazzlingly vast and the wigs and headdresses so loftily high that architecture, interiors, and furniture all had to be reimagined. Then, in a moment, these dramatic silhouettes suddenly vanished, along with the royal court. In their place were dresses so basic that they resembled the simplest of nightgowns. These unbleached cotton garments had no infrastructure and no embellishments. It just goes to show: fashion and history are inextricably linked!<br> <br>Why is it, you may ask, that the lion&#x2019;s share of fashion history books examine fashion in the Western world? The answer is simple: for centuries clothing in the Western world has changed and evolved, while clothing in the East has remained unchanged. The Indian sari; the Chinese cheongsam, or qipao; the Korean <i>hanbok;</i> the Japanese kimono have all stayed the same for thousands of years. Their evolution is in the textile. The kimono, for example, is belted with an obi that must be 12 inches wide and 4.38 yards long. How&#x2019;s that for prescriptive?<br> <br>There are many examples of beautiful clothes in these parts of the world, and their histories are also fascinating, but there isn&#x2019;t the same level of evolution. For this same reason, I&#x2019;ll also put aside discussion of the European folk tradition. Regional peasant clothing is remarkable in its consistency. There is a Bronze Age clay figurine found in Romania of a woman whose costume bears an uncanny resemblance to a Bulgarian folk costume worn in the early twentieth century. That&#x2019;s thirty-five hundred years in which the dress barely changed!1 But it&#x2019;s a dead end for us if we&#x2019;re talking about how fashion evolved to where we are today.<br> <br>When you think, by contrast, about what happened to the toga, it&#x2019;s pretty mind-blowing. The toga was just a piece of cloth that you draped around your body to preserve your modesty. The original toga was floor-length, and it was the apparel of the aristocracy. Wealthy Greeks and Romans wore it when gliding around rooms.<br> <br>Outside, the ground was filthy, so the toga became shorter once Romans started to wear it beyond their marble-floored villas. Then, of course, people noticed that the bottom half of the garment became dirtier more quickly than the top, so the toga eventually evolved into separates . . . and today into both modern sportswear and the wrap dress.<br><br>In the 1920s, the drapiness of the ancient toga returned for the first time in centuries (although not usually as explicitly as in this 1920 photograph!).<br><br>When I take students to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, I love to lead them through the museum chronologically, because that way they come to understand the evolution of ideas. Even more exciting: they start to anticipate what may come next. Everything comes from somewhere, for some purpose. That&#x2019;s why I love Renaissance painting. Every element has meaning, from a sparrow to a lily. And that&#x2019;s true of fashion, too.<br> <br>In this book I will guide you age by age through fashion&#x2019;s evolution from cavemen&#x2019;s animal hides to the latest runway collections. Just as my students cheer when paintings with perspective emerge in the Met&#x2019;s collection, I hope this book&#x2019;s readers will gasp as they see how Saxon underwear begat the cargo capri pant (and why that&#x2019;s the worst fashion trend in America today), or how the traditional Roman sandal, strapped up the leg to stay on in the heat of battle, evolved into the flip-flop worn by nearly every twenty-first-century college student.<br> <br>High, narrow heels, by contrast, have always signified wealth&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no need to walk anywhere if you&#x2019;re of such a high class that you are carried around in a sedan chair or&#x2014;in modern times&#x2014;a car. You can wear Jimmy Choos when you&#x2019;re just stepping out of the back of a limo and onto a red carpet and don&#x2019;t need to worry about getting your heel stuck in sidewalk gratings or cracks. In the 1990s, we had chunky heels, partly because it was not as fashionable to be rich during the grunge era.<br> <br>Things happen for a reason and only have staying power for a reason. Some fashion historians argue that every change in fashion reflects a focus on a new erogenous zone and that changes in necklines and hemlines stem from a desire to stave off sexual boredom.<br> <br>Fashion innovations vanish quickly if they aren&#x2019;t sustainable&#x2014;some garments return, some die out completely, and some never seem to leave at all. As I write this, some of the hippest young people in Brooklyn are running around in little tunic rompers nearly identical to those worn by soldiers in ancient Greece. Both groups value the freedom of movement such a garment provides, even if one is running on a battlefield and the other is scampering off to an indie rock show.<br><br>Jayne Mansfield shows off her high heels. A craze for clear shoes brought about the invention of sandal-foot&#x2014;or sheer-toe and heel&#x2014;panty hose.<br><br>And yet, most people are unaware of our nation&#x2019;s political history&#x2014;much less its fashion legacy. We&#x2019;re living in a woefully a-historical age. Often when I asked my students at Parsons to tell me when World War II was, no one could. It&#x2019;s especially galling that so few young designers know about American fashion history because there aren&#x2019;t even very many years to learn about! Until World War II, we were a nation of copiers. During the war, we couldn&#x2019;t copy from Europe, because the couture houses had closed. Along came American innovators like Claire McCardell and Norman Norell, representing two different aesthetics&#x2014;sportswear and evening wear, respectively&#x2014;and American creativity in fashion was born. The 1940s weren&#x2019;t that long ago, but even fashion students at some of the best schools are ignorant of what a huge shift occurred in the field during that era.<br> <br>Meanwhile, I could frequently tell which students had no historical sense simply by looking at how derivative their designs were. They kept thinking they were inventing the wheel with every new design because they hadn&#x2019;t bothered to inform themselves that the wheel already had a long and happy history. This situation always reminds me of the Phoenicians. They made reproductions of Egyptian and Greek art, but they couldn&#x2019;t read hieroglyphs, so the writing they reproduced was all gibberish. They&#x2019;d never seen a chariot in real life, so the scenes they depicted on vases showed someone standing in a little cart without the horses attached. Borrowing from cultures without understanding the fundamentals can yield some pretty weird and wholly illogical perversions.<br> <br>I am especially concerned that American fashion not be forgotten. Once, I met the head of a hot design school in the Netherlands, and she expressed nothing but contempt for American design&#x2014;an attitude I find very offensive when espoused by Europeans and downright tragic when held by Americans. When I look through <i>Project Runway</i> applications, I am always struck by how few American designers are cited in the influences section. Invariably, the only designers they name are Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, and Coco Chanel&#x2014;often misspelled &#x201c;Channel.&#x201d; You only rarely see American designers listed. If you do, it&#x2019;s usually Donna Karan. (I don&#x2019;t understand why people don&#x2019;t write Michael Kors&#x2014;even just in their own political self-interest.)<br><br>Claire McCardell is one of the all-time great American designers.<br><br>When it comes to fashion, we clearly need to become more patriotic and defend our own country&#x2019;s tradition as a worthy extension of Western fashion history. I always wonder how these people who are trying to be the &#x201c;next great American fashion designer&#x201d; can fail to appreciate any of the historically great American designers. I&#x2019;m thinking of Pauline Trig�re, Claire McCardell, Norman Norell, Bill Blass, Rudi Gernreich, Bonnie Cashin, Larry Aldrich, Geoffrey Beene . . . . The list goes on and on! Instead, many young designers I meet idolize the Antwerp Six, early-eighties graduates of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, including Dries van Noten and Ann Demeulemeester&#x2014;and if people can&#x2019;t spell &#x201c;Chanel,&#x201d; they <i>really</i> cannot spell &#x201c;Demeulemeester.&#x201d;<br> <br>While I&#x2019;m naming names, a quick note on terminology: there has been an assault in certain academic circles on the word &#x201c;fashion.&#x201d; I am unsettled by people&#x2019;s dislike of the word&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not the other F-word! Some TV executives once suggested I use &#x201c;style&#x201d; instead, because &#x201c;fashion&#x201d; is elitist. But the elite don&#x2019;t always like the word, either. A certain prestigious art school in the Northeast uses the phrase &#x201c;apparel design&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;fashion design.&#x201d; I was once on campus as part of an external review committee. In our exit interview, I told the president: &#x201c;I believe the reason the program eschews the term &#x2018;fashion&#x2019; is because this curriculum has nothing to do with fashion. It doesn&#x2019;t address the marketplace. It doesn&#x2019;t teach fashion history. It&#x2019;s basically a dressmaking school. I was bored out of my skull. No one here is interested in innovation. Don&#x2019;t you want your graduates to change the world?&#x201d; (And that, dear readers, is one way to exempt yourself from future external review committees.)<br> <br>I love the word &#x201c;fashion.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m using it in the title of this book. Fashion is about change and about creating clothes within a historical context. To me, dismissing fashion as silly or unimportant seems like a denial of history and frequently a show of sexism&#x2014;as if something that&#x2019;s traditionally a concern of women isn&#x2019;t valid as a field of academic inquiry. When the Parsons fashion department was founded in 1906, it was called &#x201c;costume design,&#x201d; because fashion was then a verb: to fashion. But the word &#x201c;fashion&#x201d; has evolved to mean something much more profound, and those who resist it seem to me to be on the wrong side of history.<br> <br>American fashion designers are doing so much in spite of severe disadvantages in the global fashion world. First of all, they have always needed to make money from their work. They&#x2019;re not subsidized by the textile mills, as the French are. And they haven&#x2019;t enjoyed any of the design piracy protections that exist in Europe. It&#x2019;s hard to be a designer in America! It takes a lot of courage and feistiness. In short: up with America; up with fashion. If I never get invited back to Europe, or to another conference on structural garment design, I can live with that.<br> <br>Lastly, before I am deluged, inevitably, with mail from academics complaining that I didn&#x2019;t mention a particular neckline or didn&#x2019;t pay proper attention to doublet construction: this isn&#x2019;t meant to be a textbook or exhaustive. Entire books have been written about what in this book are mere paragraphs. I have done my best to make sure the facts are straight, but minutiae have been eliminated. Unless you&#x2019;ve read other histories of fashion, you wouldn&#x2019;t believe the degree of complex detail with which authors write about the transition of a collar width from 1750 to 1753. Do we really care? Well, yes, but not that much.<br> <br>I encourage anyone whose interest in fashion history is sparked by this book to educate themselves further with more-academic sources. For now, I hope you&#x2019;ll enjoy this sweeping and selective look at my favorite parts of fashion history and that it will help drive home how much fun fashion, and historical inquiry, can be.<br> <br>The primary purpose of this book is to give your clothes more significance. I&#x2019;ve found that many people are afraid of taking a hard look at what&#x2019;s in their closets, because fashion is scary to many people. It shouldn&#x2019;t be. Fashion is fun and thrilling&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s something that concerns everyone who gets dressed in the morning, not just an elite crew in Manhattan.<br> <br>I hope this fashion bible will encourage you to study your clothing and appreciate its fascinating origins. Every article means something&#x2014;usually a lot of things. By exploring the meaning and history of our clothes, I hope this book will magically transform your cluttered closet into a world of wonders! To that end, I have included a work sheet at the back of the book as a guide if you&#x2019;d like some suggestions for what to look for and what questions to ask. This kind of closet inventory can teach us a lot about fashion, and a lot about ourselves.<br> <br>So, let&#x2019;s climb into our time machine and get started!</p><h2>Philippians: Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching</h2><p><p>In this commentary, Fred Craddock focuses on the text of Philippians rather than on conversations among scholars about the text. His commentary on the text differs from many other commentaries in that issues of authorship, date, place of writing, integrity, of purpose are dealt with at points where the text itself raises these issues. In order to assist those who preach, Craddock gives special attention to passages that appear in most lectionaries. Further, he draws attention to the theology of Paul as reflected in all of his letters wherever it enlightens or is enlightened by the text. Craddock helps the reader understand what it meant for an apostle and a church to be partners in the gospel.</p><p><i>Interpretation: A Bible Commentary for Teaching and Preaching</i> is a distinctive resource for those who interpret the Bible in the church.

Mann embraced his role as a public intellectual, deftly using his literary reputation and his connections in an increasingly global publishing industry to refute Nazi propaganda. As Boes shows, Mann undertook successful lecture tours of the country and penned widely-read articles that alerted US audiences and readers to the dangers of complacency in the face of Nazism's existential threat. Spanning four decades, from the eve of World War I, when Mann was first translated into English, to 1952, the year in which he left an America increasingly disfigured by McCarthyism, Boes establishes Mann as a significant figure in the wartime global republic of letters.</p></p><p><p>Tobias Boes is Associate Professor of German at the University of Notre Dame.

He now lives in an RV behind Emerson&#x2019;s house.<br><br> Together, this ragtag, mismatched trio will embark on a worldwide investigation that will expose a conspiracy one hundred years in the making.</p><p><b>Janet Evanovich </b>is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Stephanie Plum series, the Knight and Moon series, the Fox and O&#x2019;Hare series, the Lizzy and Diesel series, the Alexandra Barnaby novels and Troublemaker graphic novel, and <i>How I Write: Secrets of a Bestselling Author</i>.ONE<br> &nbsp;<br><br>It was a little after one in the morning when Riley Moon stopped struggling to make sense of the spreadsheet in front of her. She scraped her chair back from her desk, stood, and gave up a sigh. She was in a small room in a large mansion in Washington, D.C., and was surrounded by boxes, laundry hampers, and black garbage bags filled with official papers. She&#x2019;d been hired to untangle the complicated financial affairs of the Knight family, who for generations had been brilliant at making money and pathetic at keeping records. Riley had been on the job for almost two months, and she&#x2019;d reached the conclusion that it would be best for everyone if she just set fire to the office and destroyed every available document. <br><br>Her curly red hair was a rat&#x2019;s nest from a recently acquired habit of raking her fingers through it. Her brown eyes felt bloodshot. She thought a martini would fix everything, but she didn&#x2019;t have the energy to make one. She had two degrees from Harvard, a cute nose, a nice family back in Texas, and no social life. The closest she came to having a guy in her life was her boss, Emerson Knight, a man known far and wide as an &#x201c;odd duck.&#x201d; True, he was rich, brilliant, and totally hot-looking, but that didn&#x2019;t alter the fact that he was quackers.<br><br> Emerson was the latest heir to the Knight fortune, and he had no interest in either making more money or keeping better records. He simply wanted to get his family&#x2019;s affairs in order so he could keep their many charitable trusts operating while he pursued a life of investigation.<br><br> Their backgrounds were worlds apart, Riley thought. Her father was the sheriff of a small, dusty county in&nbsp; north Texas. Her mother was a second grade teacher. Her modest childhood home had unfashionable, comfortable furniture, a small backyard that was fenced for the family dog, a kitchen table that seated seven, and a dining room table that could fit a tight ten but was only used for Thanksgiving dinner. Growing up she had to&nbsp; compete with her four brothers, so she knew how to shoot, throw&nbsp; a punch, hit a hardball, and cuss.<br><br> Riley glanced out her office&#x2019;s small window and considered her options. She could traipse downstairs, get&nbsp;into her black-and-white Mini Cooper, and drive home to her Georgetown apartment, or she could select one of the many guest bedrooms just down the hall and sleep here at the Knight mansion, Mysterioso Manor.<br><br>&#x201c;The answer is obvious,&#x201d; Emerson said, standing in shadow on the far side of the room. &#x201c;It would be more efficient for you to stay here.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Crap on a cracker!&#x201d; Riley said, whipping around, hand over her heart. &#x201c;You just scared the heck out of me. How long have you been standing there?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s an interesting question. On a quantum level, either always or never.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And&nbsp; on the level we all live on except&nbsp; you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;About twenty seconds. I was checking the security monitors and I saw that your office light was still on.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t reconcile money spent through your animal rights charitable trust with money received. You seem to have too much money, but I don&#x2019;t know where it came from.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is that a dilemma?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;<br><br> Only one of many, Riley thought, looking at her boss. Emerson had a peculiar intelligence that set him apart from other brilliant people she&#x2019;d met. He was good at connecting the dots even when half the dots were missing. Unfortunately, he was also a charmingly annoying enigma with the right combination of charisma and resourcefulness&nbsp;to convince her of just about anything. And if that wasn&#x2019;t enough of a problem, he looked like a model for a romance novel cover. He was six feet two inches tall, with a lot of wavy black hair, smoldering dark eyes, and a hard-muscled, lean body. The dark hair and eyes were inherited from his Spanish mother. The muscle was the result of years of martial arts practice.<br><br>Riley agreed with Emerson that it would be more efficient for her to spend the night here. Problem was, the guest rooms were creepy. In fact, the whole mansion was creepy. It was a massive gray stone Gothic-Victorian architectural disaster with a wraparound porch, multiple chimneys, hidden passages, gargoyles, turrets, and lancet windows. It was filled with priceless bric-a-brac, elaborate woodwork, uncomfortable antique furniture, and heavy velvet drapes with gold tassels. Previous generations of eccentric Knights had lived in the mansion and filled it with their collected treasures, wives, and mistresses.<br><br> Riley was about to choose comfort over efficiency when Emerson&#x2019;s house security alarm screamed out, <i>&#x201c;Intrusion, intrusion, intrusion.&#x201d;<br></i><br> &#x201c;What the heck?&#x201d; Riley said, clapping her hands over her ears.<br><br> Emerson tapped a code into his smartphone. The noise stopped, and images from the house&#x2019;s security cameras appeared on the phone&#x2019;s&nbsp; screen.<br><br> &#x201c;Follow me,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;The game is afoot.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;Someone just broke into your house and you&#x2019;re&nbsp; quoting Sherlock Holmes?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It popped into my head. It seemed appropriate.&#x201d; &#x201c;Hiding in the closet and waiting for the police seems&nbsp;<i>more </i>appropriate.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We would have a very long wait. The alarm system&nbsp; isn&#x2019;t connected to the police. I have my own top men who handle these sorts of problems.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Vernon.&#x201d;<br><br> Vernon was Emerson&#x2019;s cousin from Virginia who&#x2019;d taken up semi-permanent residence in a monster RV he kept parked behind the mansion. He was a big, good- natured guy who had a way with the ladies and preferred fishing to thinking.<br><br> &#x201c;If there was any danger, Vernon would be here,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;He has <i>unagi.</i>&#x201d;<br><br> <i>&#x201c; &#x2018;Unagi&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br></i><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a state of total awareness. Only by achieving true <i>unagi </i>can you be prepared for any danger that&nbsp; might befall you.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley followed Emerson to the stairs, arming herself with a massive two-handed sword she&#x2019;d appropriated from a suit of armor guarding a bedroom.<br><br> &#x201c;First,&nbsp; Vernon&nbsp; doesn&#x2019;t&nbsp; have&nbsp; <i>unagi,</i>&#x201d;&nbsp; Riley&nbsp; said. &#x201c;And second, there&#x2019;s no such thing as <i>unagi. </i>You heard about it on an episode of <i>Friends.</i>&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;If there <i>is </i>an intruder I&#x2019;ll use my powers to cloud his mind so he won&#x2019;t&nbsp; see me,&#x201d;&nbsp; Emerson said.<br> &#x201c;Awesome. Great plan. And what about me?&#x201d; &#x201c;You&nbsp; have a big sword.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley mentally acknowledged that she did indeed have&nbsp; a big sword and that Emerson did have an uncanny talent for&nbsp; sneaking up on people.<br><br> They stopped on the second-floor landing and looked over the railing at a little man standing in the foyer below them. Bald head. Short. Asian ancestry. Orange monk&#x2019;s robe. Jesus sandals.<br> &#x201c;Hello, Wayan,&#x201d; Emerson called down to the&nbsp; little man.<br><br> The man raised his eyes and smiled. He put his palms together, fingers up, and bowed his head slightly in greeting. Emerson repeated the palms-together greeting and went&nbsp; down the stairs to meet&nbsp; him.<br><br> &#x201c;This is Wayan Bagus,&#x201d; Emerson said to Riley.&nbsp; &#x201c;He&#x2019;s&nbsp; the Buddhist monk I studied with during my voyage of discovery.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I thought your mentor was Thiru Kuthambai Siddhar.&#x201d; &#x201c;There are many paths to enlightenment,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;The Siddhar was also a mentor.&#x201d; Emerson turned&nbsp;to the little monk. &#x201c;How did you get here?&#x201d; &#x201c;I walked,&#x201d;&nbsp; Wayan&nbsp; Bagus said.<br><br> &#x201c;From Samoa?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I walked onto a boat. Then I walked onto a plane. <br><br>Then, when the plane landed in Virginia, I walked some more.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How&nbsp; long did it take you?&#x201d; Riley asked.<br><br> Wayan Bagus smiled politely. &#x201c;Buddha tells the story of a granite mountain that reached many miles into the sky. Every hundred years it was wiped with a silk cloth held in the mouth of a bird until the mountain was worn away to nothing. So, not so long.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley suppressed a grimace and managed a tight smile. She didn&#x2019;t want to be rude, but, criminy, wasn&#x2019;t it bad enough she had to endure this philosophical baloney from Emerson?<br><br> &#x201c;I suppose everything is relative,&#x201d; Riley said to Wayan Bagus. &#x201c;Still, it had to have been a long, difficult trip. And how did you manage to get into the house once you found it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The universe provided a way. Also, the door was unlocked.&#x201d; He turned to Emerson. &#x201c;I need your help. The island I was using as a hermitage is missing. I think it was stolen.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Define &#x2018;missing,&#x2019; &#x201d; Emerson said.<br><br> &#x201c;Gone,&#x201d; Wayan Bagus said. &#x201c;Vanished without a trace.&#x201d; &#x201c;Islands normally don&#x2019;t go missing,&#x201d;<br> Emerson said. &#x201c;Nevertheless, it is missing just the same,&#x201d; Wayan Bagus&nbsp;said.<br><br> &#x201c;Fascinating,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;Where exactly did you see it last?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It was right where I&#x2019;d left it. About two hundred miles north of Samoa.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And what makes you suspect it&#x2019;s stolen and not just lost?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For the love of Mike, Emerson,&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t steal&#x2014;or lose, for that matter&#x2014;a whole&nbsp; island.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s exactly what makes it so intriguing,&#x201d; Emerson said.<br><br> &#x201c;Last month some men appeared on my island and told me I had to leave,&#x201d; Wayan Bagus said. &#x201c;When I objected they forcibly removed me and placed me on a different island. By the time I found my way back, my island was gone.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What did these men look like?&#x201d; Emerson asked. &#x201c;Did you know any&nbsp; of them? Were&nbsp; they Samoans?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;They were wearing khaki shorts and funny hats. Only one man spoke to me, and he spoke in English. Another man gave me an injection, and I woke up hours later in the cargo hold of a boat.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Was there anything special about your island?&#x201d; Emerson asked.<br><br> &#x201c;I know of nothing that would be of extraordinary value. It was typical of the hundreds of uninhabited, unmapped islands around Samoa. It had a mountain and beaches and rain forests. It was a very nice place for a hermitage, except for the volcano.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m quite fond of volcanoes,&#x201d; Emerson said. <br><br>&#x201c;They are interesting,&#x201d; Wayan Bagus said, &#x201c;but I find&nbsp; the energy can be disruptive to meditation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Wayan Bagus was comfortably settled in a third- floor guest room,&nbsp; Emerson&nbsp; and&nbsp; Riley&nbsp; made&nbsp; their&nbsp; way to the cavernous library, with its intricate parquet floor, hand-carved oak bookshelves, and a second-level balcony. Newspapers and magazines were neatly stacked on the floor, and half a dozen whiteboards were scattered about, covered with Emerson&#x2019;s cryptic notes.<br> Some of the notes were devoted to the tangled estate left behind when Emerson&#x2019;s father had died under mysterious circumstances the previous year. Most were simply concerned with whatever sparked Emerson&#x2019;s imagination, ranging from quantum physics to tarantula crossings. A weather-beaten Coleman tent had been erected in front of the massive stone fireplace. Buddhist prayer flags hung from a line stretched between the tent and the fireplace mantel.<br><br> Emerson crossed the room, climbed a rolling ladder, and inched his way along, looking for a specific book in the&nbsp; science section.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s almost two in the morning, and the crazy little monk is asleep in bed,&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;Why are we here in the library?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wayan Bagus is many things,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;Crazy isn&#x2019;t one of them. His mental and emotional acuity are&nbsp;exceptional. If he says his island is missing, then it is most certainly missing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;And we&#x2019;re&nbsp; going to help him find it.&#x201d; &#x201c; &#x2018;We&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m changing your&nbsp; job&nbsp; description&nbsp; to&nbsp; &#x2018;amanuensis&#x2019; so you can assist me in the search. You served as my amanuensis once before, and the results were excellent.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We&nbsp; were almost killed!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The key word is &#x2018;almost.&#x2019; We survived, and, you have to admit, it was exhilarating. This will give us an opportunity to once again marry our abilities.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t exhilarating. It was terrifying. And I don&#x2019;t know about the marry thing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m using the term &#x2018;marry&#x2019; in the broad sense of the word, as in &#x2018;join together.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m brilliant and intuitive, and you&#x2019;re practical and have a driver&#x2019;s license.&nbsp; We&#x2019;re the perfect team.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br> Emerson continued his search. &#x201c;I thought I should clarify,&#x201d; he said over his shoulder, &#x201c;because I recently read a book about body language and nonverbal cues, and I decided you find me irresistible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;<i>What?&nbsp; </i>I don&#x2019;t&nbsp; think so.&nbsp; If&nbsp; anyone&nbsp; is irresistible here&nbsp;it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br><br> Emerson paused, seeming to have found what he was looking for. &#x201c;The two aren&#x2019;t mutually exclusive, but we&nbsp;need to maintain the sanctity of the amanuensis-client relationship despite our deepening physical attraction.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aha!&nbsp; So you <i>do&nbsp; </i>find me irresistible.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not at all. &#x2018;Irresistible&#x2019; would indicate a lack of control, and I have&nbsp; control&nbsp; in spades.&#x201d;<br> Emerson reached for a book, his shirt rode up, and Riley sneaked a look at the bared skin and perfectly toned abs. She narrowed her eyes slightly and thought that she had pretty good control too. Otherwise her hands would be all over&nbsp; those abs.<br><br> &#x201c;Look through this book for&nbsp; the&nbsp; section on&nbsp; Samoa,&#x201d; Emerson said, passing Riley a copy of <i>National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Nautical Maps of the Pacific. </i>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right down.&#x201d;<br><br> By the time Emerson joined Riley at the desk, Riley had found the chapter. It was page after page of detailed maps, with information about water depths, latitudes and longitudes, natural and man-made hazards, currents, and anything else you would need to know if you wanted to navigate by boat through the Samoan island chain.<br><br> &#x201c;As your amanuensis, I have&nbsp; to tell you this is insane.&nbsp; A bunch of men wearing khaki clothes stole an island? I mean, who&#x2019;s&nbsp; your prime suspect? UPS?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> Emerson flipped through the pages. &#x201c;We would have to consider UPS. They&#x2019;re always <i>losing </i>things.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What of yours have they&nbsp; lost?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ice skates. A volleyball. A sculpture&nbsp; I&#x2019;d&nbsp; created.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;And&nbsp; they never found any of it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To be honest, Tom Hanks did personally deliver the sculpture to my house, but that was several years later.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley smacked her forehead. &#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t possibly be confusing your life with the movie <i>Cast Away, </i>could you? And if you are, Tom Hanks worked for FedEx, not UPS.&#x201d; Emerson stopped flipping. &#x201c;That explains a lot. I always thought it was weird that Tom Hanks would just randomly<br> show up at my front door and give me a package.&#x201d; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re&nbsp; a very strange man.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;My Match.com profile says I have a quirky sense of humor.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have a Match.com profile?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Actually, no,&#x201d; Emerson said. &#x201c;I just have a quirky sense of humor.&#x201d;<br><br> Riley stared at him for a couple beats thinking it was a good thing he had great abs because he wasn&#x2019;t going to get far with the quirky humor. She turned her attention to the book in front of Emerson. It was opened to a map of the Pacific Ocean, showing an area about two hundred miles north of Samoa.<br><br> &#x201c;There must be at least a hundred islands,&#x201d; Riley said. &#x201c;Any&nbsp; one&nbsp; of them could be your monk&#x2019;s island.&#x201d;&lt;...</p><h2>Willing to Believe: The Controversy over Free Will</h2><p>In Willing to Believe, R.C.

She lived with them, worked with them, studied them. She dreamed of them. And because that didn&#39;t seem to be enough, in some deep, secret chamber of her heart, she mourned for them.&#39; The first victim is found lying on a sidewalk in the rain. The second murdered in her own apartment building. Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas has no problem finding connections between the two crimes. Both victims are beautiful and highly successful women; their glamorous lives and loves were the talk of the city. And their intimate relations with men of great power and wealth provide Eve with a long list of suspects - including her own lover, Roarke. As a woman, Eve is compelled to trust the man who shares her bed. But as a cop, it&#39;s her job to follow every lead...to explore every secret passion, no matter how dark. Or how dangerous</p><p>J.

She lived with them, worked with them, studied them. She dreamed of them. And because that didn&#x2019;t seem to be enough, in some deep, secret chamber of her heart, she mourned for them.</p><p>A decade as a cop had toughened her, given her a cold, clinical, and often cynical eye toward death and its many causes. It made scenes such as the one she viewed now, on a rainy night on a dark street nasty with litter, almost too usual. But still, she felt.</p><p>Murder no longer shocked, but it continued to repel.</p><p>The woman had been lovely once. Long trails of her golden hair spread out like rays on the dirty sidewalk. Her eyes, wide and still with that distressed expression death often left in them, were a deep purple against cheeks bloodlessly white and wet with rain.</p><p>She&#x2019;d worn an expensive suit, the same rich color as her eyes. The jacket was neatly buttoned in contrast to the jerked-up skirt that exposed her trim thighs. Jewels glittered on her fingers, at her ears, against the sleek lapel of the jacket. A leather bag with a gold clasp lay near her outstretched fingers.</p><p>Her throat had been viciously slashed.</p><p>Lieutenant Eve Dallas crouched down beside death and studied it carefully. The sights and scents were familiar, but each time, every time, there was something new. Both victim and killer left their own imprint, their own style, and made murder personal.</p><p>The scene had already been recorded. Police sensors and the more intimate touch of the privacy screen were in place to keep the curious barricaded and to preserve the murder site. Street traffic, such as it was in this area, had been diverted. Air traffic was light at this hour of the night and caused little distraction. The backbeat from the music of the sex club across the street thrummed busily in the air, punctuated by the occasional howl from the celebrants. The colored lights from its revolving sign pulsed against the screen, splashing garish colors over the victim&#x2019;s body.</p><p>Eve could have ordered it shut down for the night, but it seemed an unnecessary hassle. Even in 2058 with the gun ban, even though genetic testing often weeded out the more violent hereditary traits before they could bloom, murder happened. And it happened with enough regularity that the fun seekers across the street would be miffed at the idea of being moved along for such a minor inconvenience as death.</p><p>A uniform stood by continuing video and audio. Beside the screen a couple of forensics sweepers huddled against the driving rain and talked shop and sports. They hadn&#x2019;t bothered to look at the body yet, hadn&#x2019;t recognized her.</p><p><i>Was it worse,</i> Eve wondered, and her eyes hardened as she watched the rain wash through blood, <i>when you knew the victim?</i></p><p>She&#x2019;d had only a professional relationship with Prosecuting Attorney Cicely Towers, but enough of one to have formed a strong opinion of a strong woman.<i> A successful woman,</i> Eve thought,<i> a fighter, one who had pursued justice doggedly.</i></p><p><i>Had she been pursuing it here, in this miserable neighborhood?</i></p><p>With a sigh, Eve reached over and opened the elegant and expensive bag to corroborate her visual ID. &#x201c;Cicely Towers,&#x201d; she said for the recorder. &#x201c;Female, age forty-five, divorced. Resides twenty-one thirty-two East Eighty-third, number Sixty-one B. No robbery. Victim still wearing jewelry. Approximately&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She flipped through the wallet. &#x201c;Twenty in hard bills, fifty credit tokens, six credit cards left at scene. No overt signs of struggle or sexual assault.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked back at the woman sprawled on the sidewalk.<i> What the hell were you doing out here, Towers?</i> she wondered.<i> Here, away from the power center, away from your classy home address?</i></p><p><i>And dressed for business,</i> she thought. Eve knew Cicely Towers&#x2019;s authoritative wardrobe well, had admired it in court and at City Hall. Strong colors&#x2014;always camera ready&#x2014;coordinated accessories, always with a feminine touch.</p><p>Eve rose, rubbed absently at the wet knees of her jeans.</p><p>&#x201c;Homicide,&#x201d; she said briefly. &#x201c;Bag her.&#x201d;</p><p>It was no surprise to Eve that the media had caught the scent of murder and were already hunting it down before she&#x2019;d reached the glossy building where Cicely Towers had lived. Several remotes and eager reporters were camped on the pristine sidewalk. The fact that it was three A.M. and raining buckets didn&#x2019;t deter them. In their eyes, Eve saw the wolf gleam. The story was the prey, ratings the trophy.</p><p>She could ignore the cameras that swung in her direction, the questions shot out like stinging darts. She was almost used to the loss of her anonymity. The case she had investigated and closed during the past winter had catapulted her into the public eye. The case, she thought now as she aimed a steely glance at a reporter who had the nerve to block her path, and her relationship with Roarke.</p><p>The case had been murder. And violent death, however exciting, soon passed out of the public interest.</p><p>But Roarke was always news.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you have, Lieutenant? Do you have a suspect? Is there a motive? Can you confirm that Prosecuting Attorney Towers was decapitated?&#x201d;</p><p>Eve slowed her ground-eating stride briefly and swept her gaze over the huddle of soggy, feral-eyed reporters. She was wet, tired, and revolted, but she was careful. She&#x2019;d learned that if you gave the media any part of yourself, it squeezed it, twisted it, and wrung it dry.</p><p>&#x201c;The department has no comment at this time other than that the investigation into Prosecuting Attorney Towers&#x2019;s death is proceeding.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you in charge of the case?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m primary,&#x201d; she said shortly, then swung between the two uniforms guarding the entrance to the building.</p><p>The lobby was full of flowers: long banks and flows of fragrant, colorful blooms that made her think of spring in some exotic place&#x2014;the island where she had spent three dazzling days with Roarke while she&#x2019;d recovered from a bullet wound and exhaustion.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t take time to smile over the memory, as she would have under other circumstances, but flashed her badge and moved across the terra-cotta tiles to the first elevator.</p><p>There were more uniforms inside. Two were behind the lobby desk handling the computerized security, others watched the entrance, still others stood by the elevator tubes. It was more manpower than necessary, but as PA, Towers had been one of their own.</p><p>&#x201c;Her apartment&#x2019;s secured?&#x201d; Eve asked the closest cop.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir. No one&#x2019;s been in or out since your call at oh two ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll want copies of the security discs.&#x201d; She stepped into the elevator. &#x201c;For the last twenty-four hours, to start.&#x201d; She glanced down at the name on his uniform. &#x201c;I want a detail of six, for door-to-doors beginning at seven hundred, Biggs. Floor sixty-one,&#x201d; she ordered, and the elevator&#x2019;s clear doors closed silently.</p><p>She stepped out into the sixty-first&#x2019;s lush carpet and museum quiet. The halls were narrow, as they were in most multihabitation buildings erected within the last half century. The walls were a flawless creamy white with mirrors at rigid intervals to lend the illusion of space.</p><p>Space was no problem within the units, Eve mused. There were only three on the entire floor. She decoded the lock on 61-B using her Police and Security master card and stepped into quiet elegance.</p><p>Cicely Towers had done well for herself, Eve decided. And she liked to live well. As Eve took the pocket video from her field kit and clipped it onto her jacket, she scanned the living area. She recognized two paintings by a prominent twenty-first century artist hanging on the pale rose-toned wall above a wide U-shaped conversation area done in muted stripes of pinks and greens. It was her association with Roarke that had her identifying the paintings and the easy wealth in the simplicity of decor and selected pieces.</p><p><i>How much does a PA pull in per year?</i> she wondered as the camera recorded the scene.</p><p>Everything was tidy, meticulously so. But then, Eve reflected, from what she knew of Towers, the woman had been meticulous. In her dress, in her work, in maintaining her privacy.</p><p>So, what had an elegant, smart, and meticulous woman been doing in a nasty neighborhood in the middle of a nasty night?</p><p>Eve walked through the room. The floor was white wood and shone like a mirror beneath lovely rugs that echoed the dominant colors of the room. On a table were framed holograms of children in varying stages of growth, from babyhood on through to the college years. A boy and girl, both pretty, both beaming.</p><p>Odd, Eve thought. She&#x2019;d worked with Towers on countless cases over the years. Had she known the woman had children? With a shake of her head, she walked over to the small computer built into a stylish workstation in the corner of the room. Again she used her master card to engage it.</p><p>&#x201c;List appointments for Cicely Towers, May two.&#x201d; Eve&#x2019;s lips pursed as she read the data. An hour at an upscale private health club prior to a full day in court followed by a six o&#x2019;clock with a prominent defense attorney, then a dinner engagement. Eve&#x2019;s brow lifted. Dinner with George Hammett.</p><p>Roarke had dealings with Hammett, Eve remembered. She&#x2019;d met him now twice and knew him to be a charming and canny man who made his rather exorbitant living with transportation.</p><p>And Hammett was Cicely Towers&#x2019;s final appointment of the day.</p><p>&#x201c;Print,&#x201d; she murmured and tucked the hard copy in her bag.</p><p>She tried the tele-link next, requesting all incoming and outgoing calls for the past forty-eight hours. It was likely she would have to dig deeper, but for now she ordered a recording of the calls, tucked the disc away, and began a long, careful search of the apartment.</p><p>By five A.M., her eyes were gritty and her head ached. The single hour&#x2019;s sleep she had managed to tuck in between sex and murder was beginning to wear on her.</p><p>&#x201c;According to known information,&#x201d; she said wearily for the recorder, &#x201c;the victim lived alone. No indication from initial investigation to the contrary. No indication that the victim left her apartment other than voluntarily, and no record of an appointment that would explain why the victim traveled to the location of the murder. Primary has secured data from her computer and tele-link for further investigation. Door-to-doors will begin at oh seven hundred and building security discs will be confiscated. Primary is leaving victim&#x2019;s residence and will be en route to victim&#x2019;s offices in City Hall. Lieutenant Dallas, Eve. Oh five oh eight.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve switched off the audio and video, secured her field kit, and headed out.</p><p>It was past ten when she made it back to Cop Central. In concession to her hollow stomach, she zipped through the eatery, disappointed but not surprised to find most of the good stuff long gone by that hour. She settled for a soy muffin and what the eatery liked to pretend was coffee. As bad as it was, she downed everything before she settled in her office.</p><p>It was just as well, as her &#x2019;link beeped instantly.</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>She bit back a sigh as she stared into Whitney&#x2019;s wide, grim-eyed face. &#x201c;Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My office, now.&#x201d;</p><p>There wasn&#x2019;t time to close her mouth before the screen went blank.</p><p><i>The hell with it,</i> she thought. She scrubbed her hands over her face, then through her short, choppy brown hair. There went any chance of checking her messages, of calling Roarke to let him know what she was into, or of the ten-minute catnap she&#x2019;d been fantasizing about.</p><p>She rose again, worked out the kinks in her shoulders. She did take the time to remove her jacket. The leather had protected her shirt, but her jeans were still damp. Philosophically, she ignored the discomfort and gathered up what little data she had. If she was lucky, she might get another cup of cop coffee in the commander&#x2019;s office.</p><p>It only took Eve about ten seconds to realize the coffee would have to wait.</p><p>Whitney wasn&#x2019;t sitting behind his desk, as was his habit. He was standing, facing the single-wall window that gave him his personal view of the city he&#x2019;d served and protected for more than thirty years. His hands were clasped behind his back, but the relaxed pose was negated by the white knuckles.</p><p>Eve briefly studied the broad shoulders, the grizzled dark hair, and the wide back of the man who had only months before refused the office of chief to remain in command here.</p><p>&#x201c;Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s stopped raining.&#x201d;</p><p>Her eyes narrowed in puzzlement before she carefully made them blank. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good city all in all, Dallas. It&#x2019;s easy to forget that from up here, but it&#x2019;s a good city all in all. I&#x2019;m working to remember that right now.&#x201d;</p><p>She said nothing, had nothing to say. She waited.</p><p>&#x201c;I made you primary on this. Technically, Deblinsky was up, so I want to know if she gives you any flak.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Deblinsky&#x2019;s a good cop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, she is. You&#x2019;re better.&#x201d;</p><p>Because her brows flew up, she was grateful he still had his back to her. &#x201c;I appreciate your confidence, Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve earned it. I overrode procedure to put you in control for personal reasons. I need the best, someone who&#x2019;ll go to the wall and over it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Most of us knew PA Towers, Commander. There isn&#x2019;t a cop in New York who wouldn&#x2019;t go to the wall and over it to find who killed her.&#x201d;</p><p>He sighed, and the deep inhalation of air rippled through his thick body before he turned. For a moment longer he said nothing, only studied the woman he&#x2019;d put in charge. She was slim, deceptively so, for he had reason to know she had more stamina than was apparent in that long, slender body.</p><p>She was showing some fatigue now, in the shadows under her whiskey colored eyes, in the pallor of her bony face. He couldn&#x2019;t let that worry him, not now.</p><p>&#x201c;Cicely Towers was a personal friend&#x2014;a close personal friend.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Eve wondered if she did. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I knew her for years. We started out together, a hotdogging cop and an eager-beaver criminal lawyer. My wife and I are godparents to her son.&#x201d; He paused a moment and seemed to fight for control. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve notified her children. My wife is meeting them. They&#x2019;ll stay with us until after the memorial.&#x201d;</p><p>He cleared his throat, pressed his lips together. &#x201c;Cicely was one of my oldest friends, and above and beyond my professional respect and admiration for her, I loved her very much. My wife is devastated by this; Cicely&#x2019;s children are shattered. All I could tell them was that I would do everything, anything in my power to find the person who did this to her, to give her what she worked for most of her life: justice.&#x201d;</p><p>Now he did sit, not with authority but with weariness. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling you this, Dallas, so that you know up front I have no objectivity on this case. None. Because I don&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;m depending on you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I appreci...</p></p><h2>Turbulent Souls: A Catholic Son&#39;s Return To His Jewish Family</h2><p>Two years ago, Stephen J. Dubner wrote a cover story for the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> called "Choosing My Religion." It became one of the most widely discussed articles in the magazine's history. <em>Turbulent Souls,</em> the book that grew out of that article, is an intimate memoir of a man in search of a Jewish heritage he never knew he had. It is also a loving portrait of his parents.<p>Stephen Dubner's family was as Catholic as they come. His devout parents attended mass at every opportunity and named their eight children after saints. Stephen, the youngest child, became an altar boy, studied the catechism, and learned the traditional rituals of the Church -- never suspecting that the religion he embraced was not his by blood.</p><p><em>Turbulent Souls</em> is Dubner's personal account of his family; tumultuous journey from Judaism to Catholicism -- and in his own case, back to Judaism -- and the effects, some tragic, some comic, of those spiritual transformations. His parents were Jews, born in Brooklyn to immigrant parents, but -- independent of each other and, indeed, before they met -- each converted to Christianity, only to be shunned by their families. After their marriage, they closed the door on Judaism so firmly that their children had no inkling that their background was far different from what it seemed: They didn't know, for instance, that their mother had a first cousin named Ethel Rosenberg, who was executed for treason in one of the most controversial cases of the cold war era.</p><p>Stephen Dubner's is a story about discovery: of relatives he never knew existed, of family history he'd never learned, and of a faith he'd never thought of as his own and, in fact, knew nothing about. It's a fascinating, thoughtful, and thought-provoking exploration of a subject of intense interest to spiritually minded men and women everywhere.</p><p></p></p><p>"Choosing My Religion," Stephen Dubner's 1996 cover story for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, described his conversion from Catholicism to Judaism. The drama and complexity of Dubner's conversion were intensified by the author's unusual religious history: before Dubner was born, his parents had made an equal and opposite conversion from Judaism to Catholicism. Dubner's memoir, <i>Turbulent Souls</i>, expands the story he first told in the <i>Times</i> essay. In the book's prelude, Dubner explains that he began his wandering toward conversion in the 1980s when he moved to New York City, "the most Jewish city outside of Israel." <blockquote>There a certain disquietude began to take root inside me. I could not name this force, but neither could I make it leave me. And so I followed the noise inside my soul, and before long it led me back to my parents. I became consumed with a desire to know how a pair of young Jews named Florence Greenglass and Sol Dubner had become my Catholic parents.</blockquote> <i>Turbulent Souls</i> is full of loving, witty anecdotes about his childhood in rural New York state (he refers to Mrs. Ferry, a catechism teacher who gave him Doublemint gum, as "Blessed Angel of the Sugar Deprived") and his efforts in adulthood to reconstruct both his and his parents' pasts. The best reason to read this book is Dubner's well-balanced thirst for explanation and reverence for mystery; it's a model of the equilibrium every one of us has to attain if we want to make peace with our families, our home towns, and our selves. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>Stephen J. Dubner is an award-winning author, journalist, and radio and TV personality. He quit his first career&#x2014;as an almost rock star&#x2014;to become a writer. He has since taught English at Columbia, worked for <em>The New York Times</em>, and published three non-Freakonomics books.</p></p><h2>Adventures of Robin Hood</h2><p>The classic story of the man who robbed from the rich to give to the poor comes alive with vibrant illustrations from celebrated artist Greg Hildebrandt.

While this writing acknowledged the "fact" of Wilde's homosexuality, it did not, for the most part, explore the complexity of the impact it had upon his life and work. This is remedied in Neil Bartlett's <i>Who Was That Man?</i>, which squarely places Wilde in a gay historical context and literary tradition. <p> Neil Bartlett--an openly gay British novelist, critic and leading innovator on the British stage--has produced the one of the most remarkable books ever written on Wilde. <i>Who Was That Man?</i> is a personal meditation on Wilde's work and the relevance of the artist and playwright in the contemporary world. Bartlett uses his own experience as a gay man to understand Wilde's life and manages--through extensive historical research and evocative language--to make observations and connections and illuminate our understanding of the writer and his place in his own world and ours.</p>Born in 1958, Neil Bartlett works as an author and as a theatre and opera director. His novel Mr Clive and Mr Page was shortlisted for the Whitbread Novel Award and has been translated into five languages. In 2000 he was awarded an OBE for his work in the theatre, which includes productions for the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p><h2>Art of the Canoe with Joe Seliga</h2><p>Joe Seliga has been hand building canvas-on-wood canoes in his Ely, Minnesota, workshop for more than 60 years.

His sunburned arms and leathery face show the wear and tear of a rugged outdoorsman. But Howard Wooldridge isn&#x2019;t your typical cowboy. He&#x2019;s a retired police detective who&#x2019;s riding across the country to promote a provocative message&#x2014;legalize marijuana and other drugs.<br> <br>Wooldridge, then fifty-four, and his trusty, one-eyed mare, Misty, began their journey in Los Angeles in March 2005, and it would end seven months and 3,300 miles later in New York City. With a bedroll and a bag of carrots tied behind the saddle, they clippety-clopped from coast to coast, attracting attention and generating press coverage as they passed through cities and towns. Along the way, they had to contend with rattlesnakes in Arizona and New Mexico, and the blistering summer heat of the Great Plains. With the exception of a few death threats, the folks they encountered were usually friendly and many offered the veteran lawman a meal and a place to stay overnight. &#x201c;The horse is a wonderful vehicle because people relate to the cowboy cop image,&#x201d; Wooldridge explained. &#x201c;Then we start talking politics.&#x201d;<br> <br>Another surefire attention-grabber was the T-shirt he often wore, with the slogan: COPS SAY LEGALIZE DRUGS. ASK ME WHY.<br> <br>During his transcontinental trek, Wooldridge lectured on criminal-justice issues at several colleges and universities. He spoke in a disarmingly folksy &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am&#x201d; manner as he challenged students and other citizens to rethink their ideas about marijuana prohibition and the war on drugs. Wooldridge discussed his eighteen years as a police officer in Michigan and how he never once received a call for help from a battered housewife or anyone else because of marijuana. Yet Lansing-area cops spent countless hours searching cars and frisking teenagers in order to find some weed when the police could have been addressing far more serious matters.<br> <br>&#x201c;Marijuana prohibition is a horrible waste of good police time,&#x201d; says Wooldridge. &#x201c;Every hour spent looking for pot reduces public safety.&#x201d; Based on his experience as a peace officer, he concluded that &#x201c;marijuana is a much safer drug than alcohol for both the user and those around them . . . Alcohol releases reckless, aggressive or violent feelings by its use. Marijuana use generates the opposite effects in the vast majority of people.&#x201d; Officer Wooldridge decided to protect and serve the public by focusing on booze-impaired motorists. His efforts earned him the nickname &#x201c;Highway Howie&#x201d; and kudos from Mothers Against Drunk Driving.<br> <br>Wooldridge did not condone or advocate drug use of any kind, but he had enough horse sense to recognize that by banning marijuana the U.S. government &#x201c;essentially drives many people to drink.&#x201d; He felt that a substance should be judged by the actual harm it poses to the community. &#x201c;From a law-enforcement standpoint,&#x201d; Wooldridge asserted, &#x201c;the use of marijuana is not a societal problem . . . America needs to end pot prohibition.&#x201d;<br> <br>Convinced that the laws against marijuana were a lot wackier than the weed, Wooldridge and several ex-cops formed a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP) in 2002. Before long, LEAP would grow into a 40,000-member international organization composed of former prosecutors, undercover narcotics agents, judges, prison wardens, constables, and other disillusioned government functionaries who, after years of toiling in the trenches of a conflict with no conceivable end, had come to view the war on drugs as a colossal failure that fostered crime, police corruption, social discord, racial injustice, and, ironically, drug abuse itself, while squandering billions of tax dollars, clogging courtrooms and prisons, weakening constitutional safeguards, and impeding medical advances. LEAP condemned the war on drugs as America&#x2019;s longest-running bipartisan folly. Wooldridge called it &#x201c;the most dysfunctional, immoral domestic policy since slavery and Jim Crow.&#x201d;<br> <br>When law-enforcement veterans defect from prohibitionist orthodoxy, their arguments tend to be particularly potent. But Wooldridge understood that LEAP&#x2019;s views were very controversial. He knew that a long journey lay ahead, literally and figuratively, as he sought, one step at a time, to persuade Americans who had been exposed to years of government propaganda about the evils of marijuana. Many people reject the notion of legalizing drugs on moral and ideological grounds. They see marijuana first and foremost as a dangerous recreational drug, a harbinger of social decay. They believe the oft-repeated claim that smoking grass is a gateway to harder drugs.<br> <br>The &#x201c;devil&#x2019;s weed&#x201d; has long been a favorite target of U.S. officials who misstate or exaggerate the physical and psychological effects of &#x201c;cannabis,&#x201d; the preferred name for marijuana in medical and scientific circles. Although cannabis has a rich history as a medicine in many countries around the world, including the United States, federal drug warriors erected a labyrinth of legal and institutional obstacles to inhibit research and prevent the therapeutic use of the herb. They assembled a network of more than fifty government agencies and waged a relentless campaign against the marijuana &#x201c;scourge,&#x201d; a crusade that entailed sophisticated aerial surveillance, paramilitary raids, border patrols, sensors, eradication sweeps, the spraying of herbicides, national TV ads, antidrug classes in schools, and mandatory-minimum prison terms for marijuana offenders, including an inordinate number of black and Latino youth.<br> <br>In 2005, the year that Wooldridge and Misty hoofed across the states, more than 750,000 Americans were arrested on marijuana-related charges, the vast majority for simple possession. And the tally would continue to grow, irrespective of who was president or which political party was in power. Despite billions of dollars allocated annually to curb cannabis consumption, half of all American adults smoke the funny stuff at some point in their lives. An estimated fifteen million U.S. citizens use marijuana regularly.<br> <br>Marijuana is by far the most popular illicit substance in the United States, with 10,000 tons consumed yearly by Americans in their college dorms, suburban homes, housing projects, and gated mansions. Pot smoking cuts across racial, class, and gender lines. It has become such a prevalent, mainstream practice that cannabis users are apt to forget they are committing a criminal act every time they spark a joint.<br> <br>The history of marijuana in America has long been a history of competing narratives, dueling interpretations. As Harvard professor Lester Grinspoon, M.D., observed in his 1971 book Marihuana Reconsidered, some &#x201c;felt that the road to Hades is lined with marihuana plants&#x201d; while others &#x201c;felt that the pathway to Utopia was shaded by freely growing Cannabis sativa.&#x201d; And so it continues. At the center of this dispute is a hardy, adaptable botanical that feasts on sunlight and grows like a weed in almost any environment. Marijuana plants are annuals that vary in height from three to fifteen feet with delicate serrated leaves spread like the fingers of an open hand. Ridged down the middle and diagonally veined, cannabis leaves are covered, as is the entire plant, with tiny, sticky hairs. The gooey resin on the leaves and matted flower tops contains dozens of unique oily compounds, some of which, when ingested, trigger neurochemical changes in the brain. The hotter and sunnier the climate, the more psychoactive resin the plant produces during a three-to-five-month outdoor growing season. Known for its euphoria-inducing properties, &#x201c;hashish&#x201d; or &#x201c;kif&#x201d; is the concentrate made from the resin of female marijuana.<br> <br>Ancient peoples during the Neolithic period found uses for virtually every part of the plant, which has been cultivated by humans since the dawn of agriculture more than 10,000 years ago. The stems and stalk provided fiber for cordage and cloth; the seeds, a key source of essential fatty acids and protein, were eaten as food; and the roots, leaves, and flowers were utilized in medicinal and ritual preparations. A plant native to Central Asia, cannabis figured prominently in the shamanistic traditions of many cultures. Handed down from prehistoric times, knowledge of the therapeutic qualities of the herb and the utility of its tough fiber slowly spread throughout the world, starting from the Kush, the herb&#x2019;s presumed ancestral homeland in the Himalayan foothills. The plant&#x2019;s dispersal across Eurasia into northern Europe followed the extensive migratory movements of the Scythians, aggressive charioteers in the second millennium BC. A famous passage in Herodotus&#x2019; Histories (440 BC) refers to Scythians &#x201c;howling with pleasure&#x201d; in their hemp vapor baths.<br> <br>Details gleaned from various academic disciplines&#x2014;archaeology, history, anthropology, geography, botany, linguistics, and comparative mythology&#x2014;indicate that marijuana&#x2019;s historical diffusion proceeded along two divergent paths, reflecting its dual role as a fiber crop and a psychoactive flower. One path moved westward from China into northern Europe, where cooler climes favored rope over dope, while the other path, the psychoactive route, hewed to trade lines that swung southward into India, Persia, the Arab Middle East, and Africa. As it traveled from region to region, the pungent plant never failed to ingratiate itself among the locals. Something about the herb resonated with humankind. Once it arrived in a new place, cannabis always stayed there&#x2014;while also moving on, perpetually leaping from one culture to another.<br> <br>Recent archaeological findings confirm that marijuana was used for euphoric as well as medicinal purposes long before the birth of Christ. In 2008, an international research team analyzed a cache of cannabis discovered at a remote gravesite in northwest China. The well-preserved flower tops had been buried alongside a light-haired, blue-eyed Caucasian man, most likely a shaman of the Gushi culture, about twenty-seven centuries ago. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the herb contained tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of marijuana. &#x201c;To our knowledge, these investigations provide the oldest documentation of cannabis as a pharmacologically active agent,&#x201d; concluded Dr. Ethan Russo, lead author of the scientific study. &#x201c;It was clearly cultivated for psychoactive purposes&#x201d; rather than for clothing or food.<br> <br>The first reference to the medicinal use of cannabis also dates back to 2700 BC. It was subsequently recorded in the Pen Ts&#x2019;ao Ching, the pharmacopeia of Emperor Shen Nung, the father of traditional Chinese medicine. Credited with having introduced the custom of drinking tea, Shen Nung recommended &#x201c;ma&#x201d; (marijuana) for more than a hundred ailments, including &#x201c;female weakness, gout, rheumatism, malaria, constipation, beri-beri, and absent-mindedness.&#x201d; Shen Nung called &#x201c;ma&#x201d; one of the &#x201c;Supreme Elixirs of Immortality.&#x201d; &#x201c;If one takes it over a long period of time, one can communicate with spirits, and one&#x2019;s body becomes light,&#x201d; the Pen Ts&#x2019;ao Ching advises. When consumed in excess, however, it &#x201c;makes people see demons.&#x201d; Chinese physicians employed a mixture of cannabis and alcohol as a painkiller in surgical procedures.<br> <br>In India, cannabis consumption had long been part of Hindu worship and Ayurvedic medical practice. According to ancient Vedic texts, the psychoactive herb was &#x201c;a gift to the world from the god Shiva&#x201d;&#x2014;where the nectar of immortality landed on earth, ganja sprang forth. Longevity and good health were attributed to this plant, which figured prominently in Indian social life as a recreant, a religious sacrament, and a household remedy. Hindu holy men smoked hashish and drank bhang (a cannabis-infused cordial) as an aid to devotion and meditation. Folk healers relied on ganja, &#x201c;the food of the gods,&#x201d; for relieving anxiety, lowering fevers, overcoming fatigue, enhancing appetite, improving sleep, clearing phlegm, and a plethora of other medical applications. Cannabis flower tops were said to sharpen the intellect and impel the flow of words. &#x201c;So grand a result, so tiny a sin,&#x201d; the Vedic wise men concurred. There are no less than fifty Sanskrit and Hindu names for cannabis, all praising its attributes.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s been said that language reflects the soul of a people. Eskimos have dozens of words for snowflakes, which underscores the centrality of snow in Inuit culture. So, too, with cannabis nomenclature: The versatile herb has generated an abundance of terms in many languages.<br> <br>Cannabis comes from the Greek word Kannabis, which is related to the Sanskrit root canna, meaning &#x201c;cane.&#x201d; In the Old Testament, kanna-bosm (Aramaic for &#x201c;fragrant cane&#x201d;) is identified as an ingredient of the holy anointing oil, a topical applied by Hebrew mystics and early Christian healers. Galen, the influential Greek physician (second century AD), wrote of the medicinal properties of kannabis, but also noted that the herb was mixed with wine and served at banquets for pleasure. The first botanical illustration of the plant in Western literature appears in a Byzantine manuscript (AD 512) of Dioscorides, whose Materia Medica is the foundation for all modern pharmacopeias; he recommended covering inflamed body parts with soaked cannabis roots. Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, who laid the foundations for modern plant taxonomy, christened it Cannabis sativa in 1753.<br> <br>Hemp, the common English name for cannabis through modern times, usually refers to northern varieties of the plant grown for rope, paper, fabric, oil, or other industrial uses. It derives from the Anglo-Saxon henep or haenep. Differences in climate account for the paucity of hemp&#x2019;s resinous secretion compared with its psychoactive twin closer to the equator.<br> <br>Of the multitude of terms associated with the cannabis plant, marijuana is the most universally recognized and widely used within the English-speaking world (even though it is not actually an English word). Marijuana is a Spanish-language colloquialism of uncertain origin; it was popularized in the United States during the 1930s by advocates of prohibition who sought to exploit prejudice against despised minority groups, especially Mexican immigrants. Intended as a derogatory slur, &#x201c;marihuana&#x201d;&#x2014;spelled with a j or h&#x2014;quickly morphed into an outsized American myth.<br> <br>Slang words for marijuana in English are legion&#x2014;grass, reefer, tea, pot, dope, weed, bud, skunk, blunt, Mary Jane, spliff, chronic, doobie, muggles, cowboy tobacco, hippie lettuce . . . And there are nearly as many terms for getting high, stoned, buzzed, blitzed, medicated. One could fill dictionaries with the shifting jargon related to cannabis. The profusion of idiomatic expression is in part an indication of the plant&#x2019;s unique allure as well as the perceived need for discretion and code words among users of the most sought-after illegal commodity on the planet. According to a 2009 United Nations survey, an estimated 166 million people worldwide&#x2014;one in every twenty-five people between the ages of fifteen and sixty-five&#x2014;have either tried marijuana or are active users of the herb.<br> <br>Today, there is scarcely any place on earth that cannabis or its resinous derivatives are n...</p><h2>Basho and the Fox</h2><p><p>An old pond.<br>A frog jumps in.<br>The sound of water.<br>&#x2014;Basho<br><br>There are important lessons to be learned, even by proud poets, in this innovative tale of a fox who thinks he&#x2019;s a great poet and a great poet who thinks he can outdo a fox!

For more than fifty years, his friends made a circle whose circumference was vast and whose center was a fashionable tenement on New York&#x2019;s East Seventy-second street. Taxi drivers, hearing his address, would ask, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that George Plimpton&#x2019;s place?&#x201d; George was always giving parties for his friends. It was one of the ways this generous man gave back.<br><br>This book is the party that was George&#x2019;s life&#x2013;and it&#x2019;s a big one&#x2013;attended by scores of people, including Peter Matthiessen, Robert Silvers, Jean Stein, William Styron, Maggie Paley, Gay Talese, Calvin Trillin, and Gore Vidal, as well as lesser-known intimates and acquaintances, each with candid and compelling stories to tell about George Plimpton and childhood rebellion, adult indiscretions, literary tastes, ego trips, loyalties and jealousies, riches and drugs, and embracing life no matter the consequences.<br><br>In <i>George, Being George</i> people feel free to say what guests say at parties when the subject of the conversation isn&#x2019;t around anymore. Some even prove the adage that no best-loved man goes unpunished. Together, they provide a complete portrait of George Plimpton. They talk about his life: its privileged beginnings, its wild and triumphant middle, its brave, sad end. They say that George was a man of many parts: &#x201c;the last gentleman&#x201d;; founder and first editor of one of our best literary magazines,<i> The Paris Review;</i> the graceful writer who brought the New Journalism to sports in bestsellers such as<i> Paper Lion, Bogey Man</i>, and <i>Out of My League</i>; and Everyman&#x2019;s proxy boxer, trapeze artist, stand-up comic, Western movie villain, and<i> Playboy</i> centerfold photographer. And one of the brave men who wrestled Sirhan Sirhan, the armed assassin of his friend Bobby Kennedy, to the ground. <br><br>A Plimpton party was full of intelligent, funny, articulate people. So is this one. Many try hard to understand George, and some (not always the ones you would expect) are brilliant at it. Here is social life as it&#x2019;s actually lived by New York&#x2019;s elites. The only important difference between a party at George&#x2019;s and this book is that no one here is drunk. They just talk about being drunk.<br><br>George&#x2019;s last years were awesome, truly so. His greatest gift was to be a blessing to others&#x2013;not all, sadly&#x2013;and that gift ended only with his death. But his parties, if this is one, need never end at all.</p><p>Nelson W.

As his wife, I heard all the stories many&nbsp;times. One story George loved was &#x201c;Pull up your&nbsp;bowels, sir!&#x201d; which is what General Adelbert Ames,&nbsp;&#x201c;the Boy General,&#x201d; used to say when reviewing the&nbsp;men of the 20th Maine. It was George&#x2019;s way of saying,&nbsp;&#x201c;Get a grip!&#x201d;&nbsp;<i>&#x2014;SARAH DUDLEY PLIMPTON<br></i>SARAH GAY PLIMPTON Our mother may have looked down on&nbsp;Daddy a bit. It wasn&#x2019;t his fault, of course, but Daddy wasn&#x2019;t an&nbsp;Ames.<br><br>&nbsp;TIMOTHY DICKINSON It is something to be an Ames in New&nbsp;England. The Ameses have been around, making themselves felt,&nbsp;for a substantial time in that part of the world. But the fact that the&nbsp;two prominent Ames families in George&#x2019;s family tree were called&nbsp;the &#x201c;Maine Ameses,&#x201d; for their non- Boston origins, and the &#x201c;shovel&nbsp;Ameses,&#x201d; for the homely origins of their wealth . . . well, that tells&nbsp;you something about their position in the New England hierarchy.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s not like being a Winthrop, a Cabot, a Forbes, a Lowell, a&nbsp;Saltonstall, or a Lawrence&#x2014;to be one of the families whom one is&nbsp;never surprised, no matter how questionable their manners, to see&nbsp;in the Somerset Club. I guess George embraced that New England&nbsp;identity, with the Ameses carrying the Plimptons&#x2014;socially, so to&nbsp;speak. But it was, as I say, not that <i>final </i>New England eminence,&nbsp;which features no more than a dozen families.&nbsp;<br><br>PHOEBE LEGERE I don&#x2019;t know how George and I got into a discussion&nbsp;about genealogy&#x2014;at Elaine&#x2019;s!&#x2014;but we were talking about&nbsp;how both of our mothers are in the Mayflower Society. At Society&nbsp;meetings, you know, they read off the names of the <i>Mayflower </i>passengers,&nbsp;and when the name of your ancestor comes up, you stand.&nbsp;So I asked George, &#x201c;From whom are you descended?&#x201d; He said, &#x201c;I&nbsp;don&#x2019;t know, but my mother stands up five or six times.&#x201d; I just&nbsp;loved that.&nbsp;<br><br>OAKES PLIMPTON Adelbert Ames, our great- grandfather, was&nbsp;the hero in our family tree. He was the youngest general in the&nbsp;Civil War, a Medal of Honor winner, and the officer who trained&nbsp;and commanded the 20th Maine at Gettysburg, in fact throughout&nbsp;the war. Afterwards, under Reconstruction, in the South, he became&nbsp;governor, then senator, then governor again of Mississippi.&nbsp;He married Blanche Butler during this time, a daughter of another&nbsp;famous general, Benjamin Butler, who was a Radical Republican&nbsp;congressman from Lowell, Massachusetts. Adelbert and&nbsp;Blanche Ames had a daughter&#x2014;also named Blanche&#x2014;and she&nbsp;married a shovel Ames, Oakes Ames. Grandfather was a serious&nbsp;Harvard professor of botany who was the son and nephew of&nbsp;Oliver and Oakes Ames of the Credit Mobilier scandal. Grandma&nbsp;and Grandpa Ames lived in Boston and in North Easton, Massachusetts,&nbsp;where they built this big stone house on the shovel Ames&nbsp;family estate, near the factory. They had four children, one of&nbsp;them our mother, Pauline, who married our father, Francis T. P.&nbsp;Plimpton, and they had four children: George, &#x201c;T.P.,&#x201d; me, and&nbsp;Sarah, in that order.&nbsp;<br><br>JOAN AMES I never knew our great- grandmother Blanche Butler,&nbsp;Adelbert&#x2019;s wife, but she must have been a remarkable woman.&nbsp;She and Adelbert wrote hundreds of wonderful letters to each&nbsp;other. Before their wedding, she warned him, &#x201c;I have not the least&nbsp;intention of making that promise,&#x201d; meaning the vow of obedience.&nbsp;In another letter to Adelbert, who&#x2019;s in Mississippi now, she&nbsp;recounts her adventure of going swimming &#x201c;boy fashion&#x201d; with&nbsp;her sister Kate one night at the Butler summer place on Cape Ann.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s beautifully written, seductive really, and Adelbert writes back&nbsp;that he took a night swim in the Gulf of Mexico a few weeks later,&nbsp;so as to share in her experience.&nbsp;<br><br>OAKES PLIMPTON Adelbert Ames came from Rockland, Maine,&nbsp;from a family that wasn&#x2019;t so fancy as the shovel Ameses or so rich&nbsp;as the Butlers. As a great champion of black civil rights in the&nbsp;South he failed, for sure, but only when the establishment Republicans&nbsp;up in Washington, many of them hot abolitionists before the war, deserted the cause in the 1870s. That&#x2019;s when the North began&nbsp;turning against Radical Republicans like Adelbert and Butler,&nbsp;picking up the South&#x2019;s curse word for them, &#x201c;carpetbaggers.&#x201d; You&nbsp;can find the same sneer, directed at Adelbert, in Kennedy&#x2019;s <i>Profiles&nbsp;in Courage, </i>published in the late 1950s. In the South, Adelbert was&nbsp;so hated that Jesse James and his gang of bank robbers, all ex-&nbsp;Confederates, rode all the way up to Northfield, Minnesota, where&nbsp;they heard he was visiting, in hopes of killing him. They didn&#x2019;t get&nbsp;him, of course. He lived to be ninety- seven&#x2014;the oldest surviving&nbsp;Union officer&#x2014;and George actually met him. He was only six,&nbsp;but he always liked to say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve looked into the eyes of the man&nbsp;who saw Pickett&#x2019;s Charge at Gettysburg.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>SARAH DUDLEY PLIMPTON George told me they&#x2019;d met in the&nbsp;garden. George was terrified of him, he was so very old and so severe.&nbsp;His great- grandfather leaned over and picked up a stick and&nbsp;fiercely snapped it in two and said, &#x201c;Life ends like that, boy.&#x201d;&nbsp;WILLIAM BECKER I remember one time in the early 1960s when&nbsp;George and I visited his grandmother Blanche in North Easton.&nbsp;She was an extraordinary woman. According to George, she became&nbsp;incensed at JFK&#x2019;s characterization of her father, General&nbsp;Ames, as a carpetbagger and wrote letter after letter to the president,&nbsp;demanding that he rectify the calumny in subsequent editions.&nbsp;Finally she asked George to intercede with Kennedy, who&nbsp;he knew, of course. As George told the story, JFK approached him&nbsp;at a White House party begging him to persuade his grandmother&nbsp;to stop writing these scolding letters. George said he told the president&nbsp;that it might be easier to remove the slander. JFK said he&nbsp;would but in fact did not. Whereupon, at age eighty or so, Blanche&nbsp;Ames commenced writing a massive biography of her father. I&nbsp;have it, and it&#x2019;s quite good.&nbsp;<br><br>OAKES PLIMPTON Grandmother Ames was a lot of fun and figured&nbsp;out all these projects. She thought of this whole idea of a&nbsp;composting toilet and actually got patents for it. She prospected&nbsp;for oil on the Butler ranch in New Mexico; the company was&nbsp;called the Praying Mantis because that&#x2019;s what the oil rigs reminded&nbsp;her of. Unfortunately, they never struck oil. She was a suffragist&nbsp;and was also one of the people who started the Birth Control&nbsp;League in the 1930s; I think she even invented a contraceptive device.&nbsp;When some people began talking about eugenics, she quit.&nbsp;She was also an artist. She painted these incredible, lovely paintings&nbsp;of her husband&#x2019;s orchid collection; and she did landscapes and portraits.&nbsp;One drawing that this curator woman found was of a woman&nbsp;on the cross. Her feminism was one of those generational things.&nbsp;My mother was not a feminist.&nbsp;<br><br>JOAN AMES Some part of George&#x2019;s income (and mine, for that&nbsp;matter) surely came from trust funds established by our great- greatgrandfather&nbsp;Butler. Some came from the shovel Ameses, too, but&nbsp;Butler made lots of money as a lawyer after the Civil War. He was&nbsp;a social and political upstart in Massachusetts&#x2014;most definitely not&nbsp;a Brahmin&#x2014;and his wealth didn&#x2019;t stop him from winning the governorship&nbsp;of Massachusetts on the slogan &#x201c;A friend of the working&nbsp;man.&#x201d; Which I believe he was: As governor, he appointed the&nbsp;first Irishman and the first African American to judgeships. There&nbsp;is a strong streak of unconventionality in the Butler line of our&nbsp;family.&nbsp;<br><br>ROWAN GAITHER Butler is most famous, I suppose, for that infamous&nbsp;order which he promulgated as military governor of New&nbsp;Orleans. George kept a framed copy of it on his kitchen wall. It&nbsp;said that any woman who disrespected a Union soldier would be&nbsp;assumed to be a lady of the evening and treated as such. George&nbsp;also loved the story that Butler had been asked by Lincoln to be his&nbsp;vice president and that Butler had said, &#x201c;I will agree to do so only&nbsp;if you promise to die.&#x201d; So the job went to someone else.&nbsp;OAKES PLIMPTON George didn&#x2019;t talk as much about the Plimptons.&nbsp;By an amazing coincidence, they came from a village in Walpole,&nbsp;just a few miles from the Ameses in North Easton. But our&nbsp;Plimpton grandfather, George Arthur Plimpton, decided he could&nbsp;do better in New York City. And he did, which is how come our father came to be born there&#x2014;his mother died giving birth to&nbsp;him&#x2014;and eventually settled there with Mother. Grandfather Plimpton&nbsp;was president of Ginn and Company, the textbook publishers,&nbsp;and a trustee of everything from the New York Philharmonic to&nbsp;Barnard and Exeter and Amherst. Amherst and Exeter, in fact, were&nbsp;sort of Plimpton family schools. Smith, too: Mother went there, and&nbsp;so did Sarah. Our grandfather and father and uncle [Calvin Plimpton,&nbsp;Francis&#x2019;s much younger half- brother, a doctor and college president]&nbsp;and my brother T.P. went to both of them. I went to Am herst,&nbsp;but Milton before that.

If they are awakened, if the gauze wrapping their bodies is disturbed or violated, the women become feral and spectacularly violent. And while they sleep they go to another place, a better place, where harmony prevails and conflict is rare. One woman, the mysterious &#x201c;Eve Black,&#x201d; is immune to the blessing or curse of the sleeping disease. Is Eve a medical anomaly to be studied? Or is she a demon who must be slain?<br> <br>Abandoned, left to their increasingly primal urges, the men divide into warring factions, some wanted to kill Eve, some to save her. Others exploit the chaos to wreak their own vengeance on new enemies. All turn to violence in a suddenly all-male world. Set in a small Appalachian town whose primary employer is a woman&#x2019;s prison, <i>Sleeping Beauties </i>is a wildly provocative, gloriously dramatic father-son collaboration that feels particularly urgent and relevant today.</p><p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

I can get into an overcast drizzly autumn day&#x2013;great for curling up with a good book&#x2013;every bit as much as a cloudless blue summer sky, but I&#x2019;ve never cared much for snow and ice. I don&#x2019;t know how northerners put up with it. Or why. But I guess it&#x2019;s a good thing they do, otherwise they&#x2019;d all be down here crowding us out.<br><br>Native to the sultry southern heat, I was lounging by the pool in the backyard of my parents&#x2019; house, wearing my favorite pink polka&#x2013;dotted bikini that went perfectly with my new I&#x2019;m-not-really-a-waitress-pink manicure and pedicure. I was sprawled in a cushion-topped chaise soaking up the sun, my long blonde hair twisted up in a spiky knot on top of my head in one of those hairdos you really hope nobody ever catches you wearing. Mom and Dad were away on vacation, celebrating their thirtieth wedding anniversary with a twenty-one day island-hopping cruise through the tropics, which had begun two weeks ago in Maui and ended next weekend in Miami.<br><br>I&#x2019;d been working devotedly on my tan in their absence, taking quick dips in the cool sparkling blue, then stretching out to let the sun toast drops of water from my skin, wishing my sister Alina was around to hang out with, and maybe invite a few friends over.<br><br>My iPod was tucked into my dad&#x2019;s Bose sound dock on the patio table next to me, bopping cheerily through a playlist I&#x2019;d put together specifically for poolside sunning, comprised of the top one hundred one-hit wonders from the past few decades, plus a few others that make me smile&#x2013;happy mindless music to pass happy mindless time.

They weren&#x2019;t due ashore the next island until tomorrow, but twice now they&#x2019;d landed sooner than scheduled. Since I&#x2019;d accidentally dropped my cell phone in the pool a few days ago, I&#x2019;d been toting the cordless around so I wouldn&#x2019;t miss a call.<br><br>Fact was, I missed my parents like crazy.<br><br>At first, when they left, I&#x2019;d been elated by the prospect of time alone. I live at home and when my parents are there the house sometimes feels annoyingly like Grand Central Station, with Mom&#x2019;s friends, Dad&#x2019;s golf buddies, and ladies from the church popping in, punctuated by neighborhood kids stopping over with one excuse or another, conveniently clad in their swim trunks&#x2013;gee, could they be angling for an invitation?<br><br>But after two weeks of much longed for solitude, I&#x2019;d begun choking on it. The rambling house seemed achingly quiet, especially in the evenings. Around supper time I&#x2019;d been feeling downright lost. Hungry, too. Mom&#x2019;s an amazing cook and I&#x2019;d burned out fast on pizza, potato chips, and mac-&#x2019;n&#x2019;-cheese. I couldn&#x2019;t wait for one of her fried chicken, mashed potatoes, fresh turnip greens, and peach pie with homemade whipped-cream dinners. I&#x2019;d even done the grocery shopping in anticipation, stocking up on everything she needed.<br><br>I love to eat. Fortunately, it doesn&#x2019;t show. I&#x2019;m healthy through the bust and bottom, but slim through the waist and thighs. I have good metabolism, though Mom says, <i>Ha, wait until you&#x2019;re thirty.

I wept the entire time, vision and memory blurred by tears. My tears were involuntary. My soul was leaking. Alina wasn&#x2019;t just my sister; she was my best friend. Though she&#x2019;d-mailed incessantly and spoken weekly, sharing everything, keeping no secrets.<br><br>Or so I thought. Boy was I ever wrong.<br><br>We&#x2019;d been planning to get an apartment together when she came home. We&#x2019;d been planning to move to the city, where I was finally going to get serious about college, and Alina was going to work on her Ph.D at the same Atlanta University. It was no secret that my sister had gotten all the ambition in the family. Since graduating high school, I&#x2019;d been perfectly content bartending at The Brickyard four or five nights a week, living at home, saving most of my money, and taking just enough college courses at the local po-dunk university (one or two a semester, and classes like How to Use the Internet and Travel Etiquette didn&#x2019;t cut it with my folks) to keep Mom and Dad reasonably hopeful that I might one day graduate and get a Real Job in the Real World. Still, ambition or no, I&#x2019;d been planning to really buckle down and make some big changes in my life when Alina returned.<br><br>When I&#x2019;d said good-bye to her months ago at the airport, the thought that I wouldn&#x2019;t see her alive again had never crossed my mind. Alina was as certain as the sun rising and setting. She was charmed. She was twenty-four and I was twenty-two. We were going to live forever. Thirty was a million light-years away. Forty wasn&#x2019;t even in the same galaxy. Death? Ha. Death happened to really old people.<br><br><i>Not.<br></i><br>After two weeks, my teary fog started to lift a little. I didn&#x2019;t stop hurting. I think I just finally expelled the last drop of moisture from my body that wasn&#x2019;t absolutely necessary to keep me alive. And rage watered my parched soul. I wanted answers. I wanted justice.<br><br>I wanted revenge.<br><br>I seemed to be the only one.<br><br>I&#x2019;d taken a Psych course a few years back that said people dealt with death by working their way through stages of grief. I hadn&#x2019;t gotten to wallow in the numbness of denial that&#x2019;s supposed to be the first phase. I&#x2019;d flashed straight from numb to pain in the space of a heartbeat. With Mom and Dad away, I was the one who&#x2019;d had to identify her body. It hadn&#x2019;t been pretty and there&#x2019;d been no way to deny Alina was dead.<br><br>After two weeks, I was thick into the anger phase. Depression was supposed to be next. Then, if one was healthy, acceptance. Already I could see the beginning signs of acceptance in those around me, as if they&#x2019;d moved directly from numbness to defeat. They talked of &#x201c;random acts of violence.&#x201d; They spoke about &#x201c;getting on with life.&#x201d; They said they were &#x201c;sure things were in good hands with the police.&#x201d;<br><br>I was so not healthy. Nor was I remotely sure about the police in Ireland.<br><br>Accept Alina&#x2019;s death?<br><br>Never.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re <i>not</i> going, Mac, and that&#x2019;s final.&#x201d; Mom stood at the kitchen counter, a towel draped over her shoulder, a cheery red, yellow, and white magnolia-printed apron tied at her waist, her hands dusted with flour.<br><br>She&#x2019;d been baking. And cooking. And cleaning. And baking some more. She&#x2019;d become a veritable Tasmanian devil of domesticity. Born and raised in the Deep South, it was Mom&#x2019;s way of trying to deal. Down here, women nest like mother hens when people die. It&#x2019;s just what they do.<br><br>We&#x2019;d been arguing for the past hour. Last night the Dublin police had called to tell us that they were terribly sorry, but due to a lack of evidence, in light of the fact that they didn&#x2019;t have a single lead or witness, there was nothing left to pursue. They were giving us official notice that they&#x2019;d had no choice but to turn Alina&#x2019;s case over to the unsolved division, which anyone with half a brain knew wasn&#x2019;t a division at all but a filing cabinet in a dimly lit and largely forgotten basement storeroom somewhere.

Starting with the death of Augustus, Tacitus describes how the Julio-Claudian dynasty consolidated its grip upon the empire, only to end suddenly in AD 68 with the suicide of its last representative, the emperor Nero. Tacitus explores how increasingly decadent behavior by the emperors alienated the upper classes. He spares the reader no court intrigue, even while expressing his own scepticism about the accuracy of reports of scandals such as Nero&#39;s incest with his mother. Tacitus also describes the impact of the dynasty upon Rome&#39;s provincial subjects and its wars of expansion, including Claudius&#39; conquest of Britain and the subsequent revolt led by the British queen Boudicca. Biography Tacitus was born ca. AD 56, probably in northern Italy or southern France, and made his way in Rome as a newcomer. He rose to the highest political rank of consul, and subsequently acting as governor of the prestigious province of Asia. Before The Annals and The Histories, Tacitus wrote the Agricola (a historical biography of his father-in-law, who played an important role in the pacification of Britain); the Germania (an ethnographical description of the Germans living on the fringes of the Roman empire); and the Dialogue On Orators (an exploration of the declining role of rhetoric in contemporary society).</p><p></p><h2>Hatchepsut: The Female Pharaoh</h2><p>A biography drawing on archaeological and historical evidence tells of the brilliant female pharaoh who ruled Egypt for more than twenty years, but whose name and image were viciously attacked after her reign came to an end. 12,000 first printing.</p><p>Joyce Ann Tyldesley is now Honorary Research Fellow at the School of Archaeology, Classics and Oriental Studies at Liverpool University.An absorbing scholarly biography, based on a meticulous review of the archaeological record, of a remarkable woman who ruled as pharaoh for 20 years in Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1490 b.c.). Although an important pharaoh whose rule was notable for internal order and other significant achievements, Hatchepsut has suffered, Tyldesley (Archaeology/Liverpool Univ.) argues, from an unjust obscurity, born mostly from her enemies' determined efforts to obliterate her memory and from a consequent paucity of archaeological evidence about her. The daughter of Tuthmosis I and widowed by her half-brother and husband, Tuthmosis II, Hatchepsut became queen regent for the infant Tuthmosis III, whose mother was a member of the royal harem. As Tyldesley relates, Hatchepsut was a model regent at first, but in the seventh year of the reign she became pharaoh, assuming the title King of Egypt (there was no term for queen) and taking on the symbolic masculine aspects of her role, including the traditional false beard. Tyldesley contends that, contrary to a common interpretation, Hatchepsut's behavior was not that of an obsessed power-grabber, but of a typical pharaoh; she allowed Tuthmosis III to obtain the traditional pharaonic military education, she ruled with him as co-regent, and her long rule was characterized by economic prosperity and extensive monument-building, the traditional preoccupations of New Kingdom monarchs. Tyldesley argues that evidence of military conquest during Hatchepsut's reign is slender and questionable, but asserts that there were solid achievements in the realms of trade and exploration. The author speculates on the relationship between the queen and Senenmut, one of several brilliant administrators who made her reign possible. Finally, Tyldesley concludes that Hatchepsut died a natural death (in contrast to arguments that Tuthmosis III orchestrated her death). Tyldesley works closely from surviving texts and fragmentary monuments to recreate vividly an outstanding woman of the ancient past. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Generally referred to as Art Nouveau, it exerted its influence on painters, illustrators, architects, ironworkers, furniture designers, interior decorators, potters, jewelry designers &#x2014; in fact, nearly every kind of artist-craftsman. While Art Nouveau is a broad and varied style, it is almost uniformly characterized by abstract, asymmetrical, curvilinear design. The thrust of this "new art" was twofold: to elevate the status of the "crafts" to equals and partners of the "fine arts"; and to bring a designed object into a harmonious relationship with its environment through the use of lines &#x2014; either expressive or controlling &#x2014; that were natural, vital, and most importantly, organic.<br>Among the most imaginative realizations of these pervasive rhythms and serpentine patterns was the ironwork that was created during this period and still exists in major European cities (chiefly Paris and Brussels). Gates, railings, balconies, doorways, staircases, elevator cages, grilles, lampposts, and many other architectural features reveal the sinuous forms, foliate motifs, expert craftsmanship, and rich detail characteristic of the style.<br>No other existing work documents so extensively and accurately the full range of Art Nouveau ironwork. Derived from now unavailable sources, this new anthology attests to the enduring qualities of both the design and its constructive material. Graphic designers, illustrators, architects, artists, and craftspeople of all disciplines will discover numerous ornamental ideas, authentic motifs, and design solutions among the 137 royalty-free photographic illustrations. Collectors and enthusiasts unfamiliar with this particular area of Art Nouveau will delight in the exquisite craftsmanship, ornamental felicities, and juxtaposition of strength and beauty as they observe these unyielding iron creations fashioned into delicate germinating buds and wandering tendrils. Captions for the photographs provide the building, city, architect, and designer of the ironwork. These latter include such notables as Victor Horta, Paul Hankar, Louis Majorelle, Charles Plumet, and Emile Robert. Their work and that of many others is preserved in this fine selection of photographs.</p><p></p><h2>Taking on the Trust: The Epic Battle of Ida Tarbell and John D. Rockefeller</h2><p><p><strong>How a female investigative journalist brought down the world&#x2019;s greatest tycoon and broke up the Standard Oil monopoly.</strong></p> Long before the rise of mega-corporations like Wal-Mart and Microsoft, Standard Oil controlled the oil industry with a monopolistic force unprecedented in American business history. Undaunted by the ruthless power of its owner, John D. Rockefeller (1839&#x2013;1937), a fearless and ambitious reporter named Ida Minerva Tarbell (1857&#x2013;1944) confronted the company known simply as &#x201c;The Trust.&#x201d; Through her peerless fact gathering and devastating prose, Tarbell, a muckraking reporter at McClure&#x2019;s magazine, pioneered the new practice of investigative journalism. Her shocking discoveries about Standard Oil and Rockefeller led, inexorably, to a dramatic confrontation during the opening decade of the twentieth century that culminated in the landmark 1911 Supreme Court antitrust decision breaking up the monopolies and forever altering the landscape of modern American industry. Based on extensive research in the Tarbell and Rockefeller archives, Taking on the Trust is a vivid and dramatic history of the Progressive Era with powerful resonance for the first decades of the twenty-first century.</p><p>The author of six books, Steve Weinberg has been a longtime board member of the National Book Critics Circle and currently teaches investigative journalism at the University of Missouri Journalism School. He lives in Columbia, Missouri.As John D. Rockefeller builds his fortune in the oil industry that eventually becomes Standard Oil, journalist Ida Tarbell, his nemesis, investigates his business tactics. Her goal is to bust the trust that controls Standard Oil and its various subsidiaries. Pam Ward narrates this history of the oil industry, paying careful attention to the details laid out in Weinberg&#39;s research. Ward&#39;s evenly paced narration elucidates each event, each twist of fate. Point by point, event by event, her no-nonsense performance invokes the tenacity of Rockefeller, who fights to keep his empire, and Tarbell, who is determined to bring competition into the marketplace. Ward effortlessly holds the listener&#39;s attention with her straightforward delivery of Weinberg&#39;s complex tapestry of history and biography.

Original.</p><p>"This book is the closest to the truth about the `Roswell Incident' you will ever stumble upon, until that ever-mythical and distant `Day of Disclosure' dawns.

In <i>Addicted to Outrage, New York Times </i>bestselling author Glenn Beck addresses how America has become more and more divided&#x2014;both politically and socially. Americans are now less accepting, less forgiving, and have lost faith in many of the country&#x2019;s signature ideals, he says. We are quick to point a judgmental finger at the opposing party, are unwilling to doubt their own ideologies, and refuse to have any self-awareness whatsoever. Beck states that our current downward spiral will ultimately lead to the destruction of everything America has fought so hard to preserve. This is not simply a Republican problem. This is not simply a Democratic problem. This is everyone&#x2019;s burden, and we need to think like recovering addicts and change.<br> <br>With a nod to a traditional twelve-step program, each chapter encourages self-reflection and growth and shows us the way to a more hopeful, happy future. Beck draws from his own life experiences and includes relevant examples for each step, from families who learned to forgive killers to remembering to believe in something greater than ourselves to understanding the importance of humility. <i>Addicted to Outrage </i>is a timely and necessary guide for how Americans, right and left, must change to survive.</p><p>Glenn Beck, the nationally syndicated radio host and founder of TheBlaze television network, has written thirteen #1 bestselling books and is one of the few authors in history to have had #1 national bestsellers in the fiction, nonfiction, self-help, and children&#x2019;s picture book genres.

In writing this book on grieving, Van Praagh hopes to offer comfort and reassurance of eternal life, "so that you do not have to go through the rest of your days groping blindly in sorrow and pain," he explains. Yet Van Praagh also offers doses of his own hard-earned wisdom, keeping this guidebook firmly grounded in an earth-smart kind of reality.<p> <i>Healing Grief</i> is divided into four sections: The first part addresses "The Process," how humans cope with grief, including personal ruminations on the classic four stages. In part 2 Van Praagh speaks to "When Someone You Love Dies," offering specific essays on losing parents, grandparents, siblings, lovers, best friends. In part 3 he recognizes the numerous other losses that we grieve over--divorce, midlife crisis, losing a home or a job. In the final section Van Praagh speaks to reclaiming our lives, calling upon all that he believes of the after-life as well as listing specific rituals and activities that promote healing. Fans will appreciate his characteristically smooth writing style and the numerous fascinating anecdotes from his clients. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>James Van Praagh's first two books, both <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, have been a powerful healing force for millions of readers. Using his talents as a medium, Van Praagh has not only helped the bereaved reach their lost loved ones and find peace but he has also illuminated the mysteries of death, the afterlife, and rebirth. His new book, <i>Healing Grief</i>, will once again draw from his compelling and uplifting readings, but with a new and special purpose- to show what the spirit world can teach us about the grieving process itself.<br><br>While grief is clearly a natural response to death, it should also properly accompany life's other difficult passages, including times of transition, the loss of a relationship, or even the loss of a pet. <i>Healing Grief</i> begins with chapters that each examine a specific kind of loss - death of a parent, a spouse, or a child, the end of a marriage, or the onset of a troubling life change, such as unemployment or grave illness - and considers the particular bereavement issues it may engender. The book also offers advice on explaining death to children, on distinguishing healthy from destructive grief, and on harnessing the powers of healing through special exercises, meditation and affirmations. <i>Healing Grief</i> should be, in Van Praagh's words, "a manual for grieving well," offering an inspiring new perspective on grief from a world-renowned medium who has become an expert at helping people cope with unresolvable sorrow.</p><h2>Mash</h2><p>Before the movie, this is the novel that gave life to Hawkeye Pierce, Trapper John, Hot Lips Houlihan, Frank Burns, Radar O'Reilly, and the rest of the gang that made the 4077th MASH like no other place in Korea or on earth.<p> The doctors who worked in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (MASH) during the Korean War were well trained but, like most soldiers sent to fight a war, too young for the job.

Only a few decades ago, Americans were addressed as people or, in the more distant past, ladies and gentlemen. Now we are all folks. Television commentators, apparently confusing themselves with the clergy, routinely declare that &#x201c;our prayers go out to those folks&#x201d;&#x2014;whether the folks are victims of drought, hurricane, flood, child molestation, corporate layoffs, identity theft, or the war in Iraq (as long as the victims are American and not Iraqi). Irony is reserved for fiction. Philip Roth, in <i>The Plot Against America</i>&#x2014;a dark historical reimagining of a nation in which Charles Lindbergh defeats Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940 presidential election&#x2014;confers the title &#x201c;Just Folks&#x201d; on a Lindbergh program designed to de-Judaize young urban Jews by sending them off to spend their summers in wholesome rural and Christian settings.<br><br>While the word &#x201c;folks&#x201d; was once a colloquialism with no political meaning, there is no escaping the political meaning of the term when it is reverently invoked by public officials in twenty-first-century America. After the terrorist bombings in London on July 7, 2005, President Bush assured Americans, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been in contact with our homeland security folks and I instructed them to be in touch with local and state officials about the facts of what took place here and in London and to be extra vigilant as our folks start heading to work.&#x201d; Bush went on to observe that &#x201c;the contrast couldn&#x2019;t be clearer, between the intentions of those of us who care deeply about human rights and human liberty, and those who&#x2019;ve got such evil in their heart that they will take the lives of innocent folks.&#x201d; Those evil terrorists. Our innocent folks. Even homeland security officials, who&#x2014;one lives in hope&#x2014;are supposed to be highly trained experts, cannot escape the folkish designation. All of the 2008 presidential contenders pepper their speeches with appeals to folks, but only John Edwards, who grew up poor in North Carolina, sounds as if he was raised around people who actually used the word in everyday conversation. Every time Hillary Rodham Clinton, brought up in a conservative Republican household in an upper-middle-class suburb of Chicago, utters the word &#x201c;folks,&#x201d; she sounds like a hovering parent trying to ingratiate herself with her children&#x2019;s friends by using teenage slang.<br><br>The specific political use of folks as an exclusionary and inclusionary signal, designed to make the speaker sound like one of the boys or girls, is symptomatic of a debasement of public speech inseparable from a more general erosion of American cultural standards. Casual, colloquial language also conveys an implicit denial of the seriousness of whatever issue is being debated: talking about folks going off to war is the equivalent of describing rape victims as girls (unless the victims are, in fact, little girls and not grown women). Look up any important presidential speech in the history of the United States before 1980, and you will not find one patronizing appeal to folks. Imagine: <i>We here highly resolve that these folks shall not have died in vain . . . and that government of the folks, by the folks, for the folks, shall not perish from the earth.</i> In the 1950s, even though there were no orators of Lincoln&#x2019;s eloquence on the political scene, voters still expected their leaders to employ dignified, if not necessarily erudite, speech. Adlai Stevenson may have sounded too much like an intellectual to suit the taste of average Americans, but proper grammar and respectful forms of address were mandatory for anyone seeking high office.<br><br>The gold standard of presidential oratory for adult Americans in the fifties was the memory of Roosevelt, whose patrician accent in no way detracted from his extraordinary ability to make a direct connection with ordinary people. It is impossible to read the transcripts of FDR&#x2019;s famous fireside chats and not mourn the passing of a civic culture that appealed to Americans to expand their knowledge and understanding instead of pandering to the lowest common denominator. Calling for sacrifice and altruism in perilous times, Roosevelt would no more have addressed his fellow citizens as folks than he would have uttered an obscenity over the radio. At the end of 1940, attempting to prepare his countrymen for the coming of war, the president spoke in characteristic terms to the public:<br><br>"Tonight, in the presence of a world crisis, my mind goes back eight years to a night in the midst of a domestic crisis . . . I well remember that while I sat in my study in the White House, preparing to talk to the people of the United States, I had before my eyes the picture of all those Americans with whom I was talking. I saw the workmen in the mills, the mines, the factories; the girl behind the counter; the small shopkeeper; the farmer doing his spring plowing; the widows and the old men wondering about their life&#x2019;s savings. I tried to convey to the great mass of the American people what the banking crisis meant to them in their daily lives.<br><br>Tonight I want to do the same thing, with the same people, in this new crisis which faces America. . . .<br><br>We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to the task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war. . . .<br><br>As president of the United States I call for that national effort. I call for it in the name of this nation which we love and honor and which we are privileged and proud to serve. I call upon our people with absolute confidence that our common cause will greatly succeed."[1]<br><br>Substitute folks for people, farmer, old men, and widows, and the relationship between the abandonment of dignified public speech and the degradation of the political process becomes clear. To call for resolution and a spirit of patriotism and sacrifice is to call upon people to rise above their everyday selves and to behave as true citizens. To keep telling Americans that they are just folks is to expect nothing special&#x2014;a ratification and exaltation of the quotidian that is one of the distinguishing marks of anti-intellectualism in any era.<br><br>The debasement of the nation&#x2019;s speech is evident in virtually everything broadcast and podcast on radio, television, and the Internet. In this true, all-encompassing public square, homogenized language and homogenized thought reinforce each other in circular fashion. As George Orwell noted in 1946, &#x201c;A man may take to drink because he feels himself a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.&#x201d;[2] In this continuous blurring of clarity and intellectual discrimination, political speech is always ahead of the curve&#x2014;especially because today&#x2019;s media possess the power to amplify and spread error with an efficiency that might have astonished even Orwell. Consider the near-universal substitution, by the media and politicians, of &#x201c;troop&#x201d; and &#x201c;troops&#x201d; for &#x201c;soldier&#x201d; and &#x201c;soldiers.&#x201d; As every dictionary makes plain, the word &#x201c;troop&#x201d; is always a collective noun; the &#x201c;s&#x201d; is added when referring to a particularly large military force. Yet each night on the television news, correspondents report that &#x201c;X troops were killed in Iraq today.&#x201d; This is more than a grammatical error; turning a soldier&#x2014;an individual with whom one may identify&#x2014;into an anonymous-sounding troop encourages the public to think about war and its casualties in a more abstract way. Who lays a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Troop? It is difficult to determine exactly how, why, or when this locution began to enter the common language. Soldiers were almost never described as troops during the Second World War, except when a large military operation (like the Allied landing on D-Day) was being discussed, and the term remained extremely uncommon throughout the Vietnam era. My guess is that some dimwits in the military and the media (perhaps the military media) decided, at some point in the 1980s, that the word &#x201c;soldier&#x201d; implied the masculine gender and that all soldiers, out of respect for the growing presence of women in the military, must henceforth be called troops. Like unremitting appeals to folks, the victory of troops over soldiers offers an impressive illustration of the relationship between fuzzy thinking and the debasement of everyday speech.<br><br>By debased speech, I do not mean bad grammar, although there is plenty of that on every street corner and talk show, or the prevalence of obscene language, so widespread as to be deprived of force and meaning at those rare times when only an epithet will do. Nor am I talking about Spanglish and so-called Black English, those favorite targets of cultural conservatives&#x2014;although I share the conservatives&#x2019; belief that public schools ought to concentrate on teaching standard English. But the standard of standard American English, and the ways in which private speech now mirrors the public speech emanating from electronic and digital media, is precisely the problem. Debased speech in the public square functions as a kind of low-level toxin, imperceptibly coarsening our concept of what is and is not acceptable until someone says something so revolting&#x2014;Don Imus&#x2019;s notorious description of female African-American college basketball players as &#x201c;nappy-headed hos&#x201d; is the perfect example&#x2014;that it produces a rare, and always brief, moment of public consciousness about the meaning and power of words. Predictably, the Imus affair proved to be a missed opportunity for a larger cultural conversation about the level of all American public discourse and language. People only wanted to talk about bigotry&#x2014;a worthy and vital conversation, to be sure, but one that quickly degenerated into a comparative lexicon of racial and ethnic victimology. Would Imus have been fired for calling someone a faggot or a dyke? What if he had only called the women hos, without the additional racial insult of nappy-headed? And how about Muslims? Didn&#x2019;t Ann Coulter denigrate them as &#x201c;ragheads&#x201d; (a slur of which I was blissfully unaware until an indignant multiculturalist reported it on the op-ed page of <i>The New York Times</i>).[3] The awful reality is that all of these epithets, often accompanied by the F-word, are the common currency of public and private speech in today&#x2019;s America. They are used not only because many Americans are infected by various degrees of bigotry but because nearly all Americans are afflicted by a poverty of language that cheapens humor and serious discourse alike. The hapless Imus unintentonially made this point when he defended his remarks on grounds that they had been made within a humorous context. &#x201c;This is a comedy show,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;not a racial rant.&#x201d; Wrong on both counts. Nothing reveals a lack of comic inventiveness more reliably than the presence of reflexive epithets, eliciting snickers not because they exist within any intentional &#x201c;context&#x201d; but simply because they are crass words that someone is saying out loud.<br><br>Part of Imus&#x2019;s audience was undoubtedly composed of hard-core racists and misogynists, but many more who found his rants amusing were responding in the spirit of eight-year-olds laughing at farts. Imus&#x2019;s &#x201c;serious&#x201d; political commentary was equally pedestrian. He frequently enjoined officials who had incurred his displeasure to &#x201c;just shut up,&#x201d; displaying approximately the same level of sophistication as Vice President Dick Cheney when he told Senator Patrick J. Leahy on the Senate floor, &#x201c;Go fuck yourself.&#x201d; As the genuinely humorous Russell Baker observes, previous generations of politicians (even if they had felt free to issue the physically impossible Anglo-Saxon injunction in a public forum) would have been shamed by their lack of verbal inventiveness. In the 1890s, Speaker of the House Thomas Reed took care of one opponent by observing that &#x201c;with a few more brains he could be a halfwit.&#x201d; Of another politician, Reed remarked, &#x201c;He never opens his mouth without subtracting from the sum of human intelligence.&#x201d;[4] Americans once heard (or rather, read) such genuinely witty remarks and tried to emulate that wit. Today we parrot the witless and halfwitted language used by politicians and radio shock jocks alike.<br><br>The mirroring process extends far beyond political language, which has always existed at a certain remove from colloquial speech. The toxin of commercially standardized speech now stocks the private vault of words and images we draw on to think about and to describe everything from the ridiculous to the sublime. One of the most frequently butchered sentences on television programs, for instance, is the incomparable Liberace&#x2019;s cynically funny, &#x201c;I cried all the way to the bank&#x201d;&#x2014;a line he trotted out whenever serious critics lambasted his candelabra-lit performances as kitsch.[5] The witty observation has been transformed into the senseless catchphrase, &#x201c;I laughed all the way to the bank&#x201d;&#x2014;often used as a non sequitur after news stories about lottery winners. In their dual role as creators of public language and as microphones amplifying and disseminating the language many American already use in their daily lives, the media constitute a <i>perpetuum mobile</i>, the perfect example of a machine in which cause and effect can never be separated. A sports broadcaster, speaking of an athlete who just signed a multi-year, multi-million-dollar contract, says, &#x201c;He laughed all the way to the bank.&#x201d; A child idly listening&#x2014;perhaps playing a video game on a computer at the same time&#x2014;absorbs the meaningless statement without thinking and repeats it, spreading it to others who might one day be interviewed on television and say, &#x201c;I laughed all the way to the bank,&#x201d; thereby transmitting the virus to new listeners. It is all reminiscent of the exchange among Alice, the March Hare, and the Mad Hatter in <i>Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland</i>. &#x201c;Then you should say what you mean,&#x201d; the March Hare tells Alice. &#x201c; &#x2018;I do,&#x2019; Alice hastily replied; &#x2018;at least&#x2014;at least I mean what I say&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the same thing, you know.&#x2019; &#x201d; The Hatter chimes in, &#x201c;Not the same thing a bit! Why, you might just as well say that &#x2018;I see what I eat&#x2019; is the same thing as &#x2018;I eat what I see&#x2019;!&#x201d; In an ignorant and anti-intellectual culture, people eat mainly what they see.<br><b>NOTES</b><br><br>[1] Franklin Delano Roosevelt, <i>Fireside Chats</i> (New York, 1995), pp. 48-49, 62-63.<br>[2] George Orwell, &#x201c;Politics and the English Language,&#x201d; Horizon, 76 (London: 1946); www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit.<br>[3] Robert Wright, &#x201c;Shock Talk Without Apologies,&#x201d; <i>New York Times</i>, April 14, 2007.<br>[4] Russell Baker, &#x201c;Talking It Up,&#x201d; <i>New York Review of Books</i>, May 11, 2006.<br>[5] Liberace first used this line in 1957, when he won a libel judgment against the British tabloid <i>Daily Mirror</i>, which published a column calling the entertainer a &#x201c;deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, chromium-plated, scent-impregnated, luminous, giggling, fruit-flavored, mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love.&#x201d; The British court concluded that the article had libelously implied that Liberace was a homosexual (which, of course he was, but there was no proof).<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>California Fire and Life</h2><p>An insurance claims investigator, Jack Wade speaks the language of fire.

His expert knowledge pays off in <i>California Fire and Life</i>, a giant fireball of a thriller about ace arson investigator Jack Wade. Want to know why thick, oily soot on glass might be a sign of arson? Or why arsonists never burn their dogs? Or what the presence of "alligator char" means? You'll learn about this and much more, as Jack sifts through the ashes of a mansion in Orange County on behalf of the insurance company that he works for. A young wife and mother named Pamela Vale burned to death in the fire. Bentley, the sloppy and possibly corrupt sheriff's department fire investigator, claims that it was a case of drinking too much vodka and dropping a cigarette. Jack has his doubts--especially when he meets the woman's ex-husband, Nicky Vale, a slick Russian entrepreneur (read mafia chief) born Daziatnik Valeshin.<p> Before signing off on the multimillion-dollar insurance policy on Mrs. Vale's life and house, Jack does some more digging. Meanwhile, his old girlfriend--a policewoman who just happens to be the dead woman's half-sister--finds a link between Nicky Vale's Russian mob and a Vietnamese gang of criminals. Jack's insurance firm begins to act strangely, pressuring him to settle the Vale claim. There may be a little too much technical data in <i>California Fire and Life</i>, but Jack--who lives only to surf and investigate arson--is still a fresh and fascinating creation. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>"Intriguing and suspenseful."<br>--The San Diego Union-Tribune<br><br>"[A] jazzy California thriller . . .
